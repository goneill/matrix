Cote";"ORDER as to Prince Uko, Jacob Sagiao, Marylynn Peneueta, Britt Jackson, Joshua Fitten, Dontae Coterell, Arinze Obika, Ndukwe Anyaogu, Herman Bass, David Uro, Victor Ahaiwe: An arraignment and initial pretrial conference in this case is scheduled to occur on Friday, March 27, 2020. The defendants who require appointment of counsel were ordered to appear before the Magistrate Judge on March 26 to arrange for the appointment of counsel in this district. Through an Order issued by the Chief Judge of this district on March 13, time has been excluded under the Speedy Trial Act until April 27, 2020, for the reasons explained in that Order, for all cases pending in this district. It is hereby ORDERED that the March 27 conference will proceed as scheduled for those defendants who wish to appear at that time before this Court. No trial date will be set at that time. Any defendant who wishes to appear on March 27 must notify the Government of that intention no later than March 25 and, if they need counsel to be appointed to represent them, to appear before the Magistrate Judge in Courtroom 228, 40 Foley Square on March 26 at 9 am for appointment of counsel. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a conference at which all defendants must appear is scheduled for Friday, May 8, 2020, at noon in Courtroom 18B, 500 Pearl Street. A trial date will be set at that time. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any defendant who requires appointment of counsel and does not have appointed counsel in this district shall appear before the Magistrate Judge in Courtroom 228, 40 Foley Square on May 7 at 9 am for appointment of counsel. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Government shall provide counsel of each defendant with this Order. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, for the reasons stated in the Order of the Chief Judge of the Southern District of New York on March 13, because public health concerns currently discourage movement of persons, and because many of the defendants named in this indictment reside in locations distant from New York City, time under the Speedy Trial Act is excluded from March 13 until May 8, 2020. That exclusion is in the interest of justice and outweighs the best interests of the defendants and the public in a speedy trial. 18 U.S.C. § 3161.

An Order of March 15, 2020 misstated the Magistrate Judges Courtroom for arraignment proceedings. This Order has been revised where underlined below, to provide accurate courtroom numbers.An arraignment and initial pretrial conference in this case is scheduled to occur on Friday, March 27, 2020. The defendants who require appointment of counsel were ordered to appear before the Magistrate Judge on March 26 to arrange for the appointment of counsel in this district. Through an Order issued by the Chief Judge of this district on March 13, time has been excluded under the Speedy Trial Act until April 27, 2020, for the reasons explained in that Order, for all cases pending in this district. It is hereby ORDERED that the March 27 conference will proceed as scheduled for those defendants who wish to appear at that time before this Court. No trial date will be set at that time. Any defendant who wishes to appear on March 27 must notify the Government of that intention no later than March 25 and, if they need counsel to be appointed to represent them, to appear before the Magistrate Judge in Courtroom 5A, 500 Pearl Street, New York, New York, 10007 on March 26 at 9 am for appointment of counsel. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a conference at which all defendants must appear is scheduled for Friday, May 8, 2020, at noon in Courtroom 18B, 500 Pearl Street. A trial date will be set at that time. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any defendant who requires appointment of counsel and does not have appointed counsel in this district shall appear before the Magistrate Judge in Courtroom 5A, 500 Pearl Street, on May 7 at 9 am for appointment of counsel. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Government shall provide counsel of each defendant with this Order. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, for the reasons stated in the Order of the Chief Judge of the Southern District of New York on March 13, because public health concerns currently discourage movement of persons, and because many of the defendants named in this indictment reside in locations distant from New York City, time under the Speedy Trial Act is excluded from March 13 until May 8, 2020. That exclusion is in the interest of justice and outweighs the best interests of the defendants and the public in a speedy trial. 18 U.S.C. § 3161. (Signed by Judge Denise L.

The Court recently contacted counsel for all parties about the prospect of moving the trial date to June 15, 2020, in recognition of the present public health emergency in New York City. In response, counsel wisely recommend instead that a conference be held on April 27, 2020, to take stock of the then pending circumstances and to then set a trial date, or other schedule, that is reasonable in light of those circumstances. The Court agrees with that approach. The Court accordingly schedules a next conference in this case for April 27, 2020, at 9:30 a.m. All intermediate dates and deadlines are adjourned. For avoidance of doubt, time is excluded until April 27, 2020, pursuant to section 3161(h)(7)(A) of the Speedy Trial Act, pursuant to the prior order in this case excluding time, pursuant to Chief Judge McMahon's standing order excluding time until that date, and pursuant to this Court's current finding that the interests of justice, particularly in enabling counsel to adapt to the challenges presented by the public health crisis, justify the exclusion.

The Government seeks the exclusion of the foregoing period in the interest of justice for the Government and defendant to discuss a disposition of this case without the need for trial.

Following his February 5 admission to two specifications of violation of probation, the defendant was scheduled to be sentenced on March 4, 2020. At the March 4 sentencing proceeding, after the Court indicated that it was considering the guidelines range of between 12 to 18 months that applied at the time the defendant was originally sentenced on October 4, 2019, the defendant requested an adjournment to submit additional information for the Courts consideration. That submission was due March 16. On March 15, the Court ordered the parties to confer as to whether the March 19 sentencing should be adjourned in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. On March 16, defense counsel responded stating inter alia that he did not not oppose the Courts decision to adjourn the March 19 sentencing. The March 15 Order, however, did not adjourn the sentencing. Defense counsel also requested that the defendant be released on bail pending sentence. On March 17, the Government consented to the adjournment but opposed the application for bail. On March 18, defense counsel filed his response. Defense counsel concluded his letter by stating [I] will attend the March 19th sentencing or a subsequent date should the Court elect to not release Mr. Fofana and proceed with sentencing. On March 18, defense counsel advised the Court that he consented to the adjournment of sentencing in the event the defendant was not released on bail. Being familiar with the record in this case, having reviewed the letters by counsel, and having considered each of the arguments presented in those letters, it is hereby ORDERED that the March 19 sentencing date is adjourned to May 8 at 2 p.m. in Courtroom 18B, 500 Pearl Street.

In sum, circumstances that have changed since the March 6 hearing warrant reconsideration of the Defendant's bail conditions, and the Court concludes that, in light of these changed circumstances, the Defendant has established by clear and convincing evidence that he does not pose a danger to the community. Furthermore, even were the Court to conclude that reconsideration was not warranted, compelling reasons would necessitate the Defendant's temporary release under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i). Accordingly, the Court orders the Defendant released from the custody of the Bureau of Prisons to the custody of his mother, with whom he lives, subject to the additional conditions of supervised release of 24-hour home incarceration at his current residence in the Bronx and electronic location monitoring as directed by the Probation Department.

In any event, while counsel have had months to prepare, lawyers tend to leave things to the last minute. (This situation illustrates why that is a bad idea.) And while there is a mandatory life term for each Defendant, they are entitled to all the formalities. Mr. Crea and Mr. Londonio can communicate with counsel by phone or email so they should file their submissions by 3/20/20. Mr. Madonna has a harder time with that, so I will extend his time to 3/23/20.

(ECF No. 7.) This Court ordered Mr. Spilke to submit an Amended Petition by March 9, 2020. (ECF No. 4.) On March 11, 2020, Mr. Spilke informed the Court, by email, that he had recorded an incorrect deadline for the submission in his calendar- that he was on trial- and it was unlikely that he would file an Amended petition. Mr. Spilke asked the Court for a week to confirm that he would not file an Amended Petition, and the Court granted his request. (ECF No. 8.) A week later, on March 18, 2020, Mr. Spilke notified the Court, by letter, that his client does not intend to file an Amended Petition. (ECF No. 9.) A district court's denial of a habeas petition must be vacated under Rule 60(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if the defendant's "lawyer agreed to prosecute [the] habeas petitioner's case, abandoned it, and consequently deprived the petitioner of any opportunity to be heard at all." Harris v. United States, 367 F.3d 74, 81 (2d Cir. 2004). At present, the record is inadequate as to whether Mr. Spilke has discharged his duties to his client within the meaning of Harris. To ensure that the Court's eventual judgment on Defendant's habeas petition is valid, the Court orders Mr. Spilke to inform the Court, by Affidavit, by March 26, 2020, of the following: (1) Whether Mr. Spilke has discussed the petition with his client, a. Orally or in writing? If in writing, Mr. Spilke shall send the court a copy of any relevant writing(s) by March 26, 2020. b. When? c. What was discussed? d. Does anything remain to be discussed? (2) Whether Mr. Spilke has done any legal research regarding the petition.

The request was based on the rapid spread of COVID-19. The government opposed this request. By Wednesday, March 25, 2020, the parties should submit additional letters to the Court. Defense Counsel should indicate whether she has been able to set up legal visits with her client through telephone. If so, she should indicate whether there have been any restrictions on the number of calls she can schedule with her client, the duration of those calls, or the privacy available during those calls. The government similarly should indicate whether it has any knowledge as to restrictions that have been put in place with respect to legal calls at MDC.

Now before me is Ortiz's petition, filed on January 16, 2020 pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255, in which Ortiz seeks to vacate his conviction on Count Four for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, on the ground that conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery is not a "crime of violence." See ECF No. 103. The petition is granted. On November 1, 2019, I granted a substantively identical petition filed by Ortiz's co-defendant, Angel Velasquez. See ECF No. 95. There, I noted that, inter alia, per recent Supreme Court and Second Circuit decisions, conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery is no longer a valid "crime of violence" predicate for purposes of section 924(c). I found that Velasquez's plea allocution--Velasquez, like Ortiz, allocuted only to his conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery and possession of a firearm in furtherance of that conspiracydid not substantiate any predicate for the section 924(c) violation other than conspiracy to commitHobbs Act robbery. Thus, I vacated that Velasquezs section 924(c) conviction. So too here.(See Footnote 1 on this Order). Ortiz's plea allocution lacks support for a section 924(c) predicate offense other than the conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery to which he pled. Accordingly, and for all the reasons set forth in my order as to Velasquez, see ECF No. 95.(See Footnote 2 on this Order). The Clerk is directed to close out the open motion (ECF No. 103).

Michael Cohen purports to move under Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to reduce or modify his sentence. Specifically, Cohen seeks to reduce his sentence to 12 months and one day of imprisonment, or alternatively, to modify his sentence so that the balance of his 36-month term is served on home confinement. The fatal flaw in Cohen's motion is that only the prosecutor can file a Rule 35(b) motion. And the Government's decision not to file such a motion is entitled to considerable deference. United States v. Scarpa, 861 F.3d 59, 69 (2d Cir. 2017) ("In sum, when the U.S. Attorney has refused to make a Rule 35(b) motion for reasons that are not invidious or unrelated to a legitimate government concern, it is not the office of the court to weigh the equities or reassess the facts underlying the government's exercise of its discretion."). Stated differently, courts second guess the government's refusal to file a Rule 35(b) motion only where the government acted with an unconstitutional motive or where its refusal was not rationally related to a legitimate government end. See Scarpa, 861 F.3d at 68 (collecting cases)....[See this Memorandum & Order]... Apparently searching for a new argument to justify a modification of his sentence to home confinement, Cohen now raises the specter of COVID-19. (ECF No. 69.) That Cohen would seek to single himself out for release to home confinement appears to be just another effort to inject himself into the news cycle. As the Government points out, he is "manifestly ineligible" for compassionate release and has not exhausted his administrative remedies. (ECF No. 70.) Ten months into his prison term, it's time that Cohen accept the consequences of his criminal convictions for serious crimes that had far reaching institutional harms. For these reasons, Cohen's application to reduce or modify his sentence is denied. SO ORDERED: (Signed by Judge William H. Pauley, III on 3/24/2020)(bw)"

Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i), this Court concludes that compelling reasons exist for temporary release of Defendant from custody during the current public health crisis. Accordingly, Defendant's application is GRANTED with the following conditions: a. Defendant is released on his own recognizance- b. GPS ankle bracelet to be enforced- c. Pretrial Services supervision as directed by Pretrial Services Office- d. Surrender all passports and other travel documents and make no applications for new or replacement documents- e.

Mr. Bryant has moved for an order correcting his sentence pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(a). (Docket Entry No. 135.) The Court has thoroughly reviewed and considered the arguments made by both parties,(See Footnote 1 on this Order) and for the following reasons, denies Mr. Bryant's motion.... Accordingly, the Court did not overlook or fail to consider any of the required section 3553(a) factors, nor did it fail to consider Mr. Bryant's argument that incarceration would "needlessly" expose him to risk of infection. (Docket Entry No. 135, at 10.) The Court determined that, in light of the factual record and the statutory sentencing goals, there remained a continued need for incarceration. (Docket Entry No. 135, Ex. A, at 30:3-4.) The Court is sympathetic to the concerns of Mr. Bryant, and indeed the country, as the risks posed by the coronavirus become ever more realized. However, because there was no "arithmetic, technical, or clear error" in the imposition of Mr. Bryant's sentence, Rule 35(a) cannot properly be invoked to address those concerns. The motion is denied. Docket Entry No. 135 is resolved. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Laura Taylor Swain on 3/24/2020) (bw)"

The Court has received a letter request from defense counsel seeking a modification of the sentence of defendant Daniel Hernandez. Dkt. 437. Counsel represents that Mr. Hernandez is expected to be released from custody on or about July 31, 2020. Counsel asks the Court to modify the sentence to provide that the remaining months of Mr. Hernandez's prison sentence be served pursuant to home confinement, to reduce the risk that Mr. Hernandez, who has been diagnosed with asthma, will contract COVID-19 in prison. Id. The Court has also received a letter from the Government opposing this request, largely on the ground that the Court lacks authority to grant this request, Dkt. 438, and a letter reply from counsel for Mr. Hernandez, Dkt. 439. The Court is constrained to deny Mr. Hernandez's request. Having canvassed potential sources of legal authority, the Court concludes that it lacks the legal authority to thus modify his sentence. And counsel for Mr. Hernandez, in his letters, has not identified any available such authority. Briefly:...[See this Order]... The Court, however, is prepared to state the following, as it may be instructive guidance to the Bureau of Prisons in considering an application by Mr. Hernandez for release on home confinement. The Court's judgment at sentencing was that the § 3553(a) factors required imposition of the sentence imposed. And based on the same assessment, the Court later rejected Hernandez's motion to modify his sentence to substitute home confinement for the balance of his term of imprisonment, Dkt. 409, on the grounds that such a modification "would disserve the assembled 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors, including that Mr. Hernandez's sentence reflect the seriousness of his crimes." Dkt. 411. At the time of sentencing, however, the Court did not know and could not have known that the final four months of Mr. Hernandez's sentence would be served at a time of a worldwide pandemic to which persons with asthma, like Mr. Hernandez, have heightened vulnerability. Section 3553(a) instructs a sentencing court to consider, inter alia, the "history and characteristics of the defendant" and "the need to provide the defendant with needed... medical care." 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). Had the Court known that sentencing Mr. Hernandez to serve the final four months of his term in a federal prison would have exposed him to a heightened health risk, the Court would have directed that these four months be served instead in home confinement. The Court accordingly denies Mr. Hernandez's motion for relief. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Paul A. Engelmayer on 3/25/2020)(bw)"

It is sometimes hard to tell if an individual really has gotten with the program or has simply figured out what to say to make it sound as if he is. Mr. McCardle should know that if it turns out that he is using the corona virus or his father's situation for his selfish advantage, he will pay the price when he next sees me. But I will take a chance that this time Mr. McCardle has really taken drug treatment seriously. I give him enormous credit for the fact that he has achieved 7 months of sobriety -- which is a real feat. If Mr. McCardle on April 20, 2020 completes the phase he is now in with no problems, he may discontinue outpatient treatment and continue his supervised release from his father's home, with outpatient treatment and whatever other supervision and testing Probation believes is advisable. I sincerely hope that Mr. McCardle has really turned his life around and that he has no more occasion to be in court. I wish him the best of luck. Mr. Ginsburg shall ensure that Mr. McCardle is advised of what I have said today. The Government shall inform Probation of this Order.. (Signed by Judge Cathy Seibel on 03/26/2020) (Seibel, Cathy)"

On February 27, 2020, after imposition of the sentence but before the judgment was filed, the Correction Officers' Benevolent Association ("COBA") moved to amend the sentence to recognize COBA's full right to restitution, as a victim of the Rechnitz-Huberfeld-Seabrook conspiracy....[See this Order Denying Motion For Restitution]...

WHEREAS on January 30, 2020, the Court denied Defendant Emmanuel Bonafe's motion for reconsideration of his pretrial detention, Hearing Tr. (Dkt. 90) at 42- WHEREAS the Court found that "no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure... the safety of any other person and the community," 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1), based on the Government's proffer that Mr. Bonafe has been a high ranking member of the Latin Kings, who has professed access to firearms and has participated in multiple assaults and robberies, see Hearing Tr. at 42- WHEREAS Mr. Bonafe has submitted a second motion for reconsideration of his detention based on audio recordings received during discovery, which in Defendants' view, show that one of the assaults discussed at the hearing was not a "slashing" (the term used at the hearing) because a knife might not have been used during the attack, see Exs. 1, 3(See Footnote 1 on this Order)- WHEREAS Mr. Bonafe also seeks reconsideration based on the COVID-19 outbreak, which has reportedly hindered his access to the law library and his ability to review materials produced during discovery, see Ex. 3- WHEREAS Mr. Bonafe has waived his right to appear at a hearing and has requested that his motion be decided on the papers- and WHEREAS Mr. Bonafe, due to the nature of the crimes charged in the indictment, faces a rebuttable presumption that "no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the community," 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)- IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Mr. Bonafe's renewed application is DENIED. After reviewing the audio recordings and considering all of defense counsel's arguments, the Court continues to find that no condition or combination of conditions of release will reasonably assure the safety of the community, and that Mr. Bonafe has not rebutted the presumption of detention. Even if one of the assaults for which Mr. Bonafe was present (and likely participated in) did not involve a knife, a fact that is far from clear in the audio excerpts, the record continues to show that Mr. Bonafe is a high-ranking and influential member of a violent organization, who has himself participated in robberies and other acts of violence. See, e.g., Hearing Tr. at 2529. The Court further finds that the impact of COVID-19 on Mr. Bonafe's ability to review discovery materials in the law library does not compel his release- he is directed to raise his right to review discovery in his case to the legal staff at his facility, and his counsel may file a letter motion with the Court if the issue remains unresolved. Defendant's remaining arguments were advanced and considered at the prior hearing and require no further exposition. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Valerie E. Caproni on 3/26/2020)(bw)"

Essentially utilizing a form letter, see ECF No. 13, defendant has sought release on bail because of the COVID-19 virus and its potential impact on his health and interference with direct contact with counsel. Defendant's application proceeds on an erroneous premise, namely, that defendant's lifelong ties to New York "would be sufficient under normal circumstances to overcome the presumption of pre-trial detention." ECF No. 13 at 3.... [See this Memorandum and Order]... Finally, there is no suggestion in defendant's submission that by virtue of a pre-existing health condition he faces an unusual risk from the coronavirus. In sum, defendant would be detained as both a danger to the community and a risk of flight under normal circumstances and has failed to demonstrate why a different result should obtain under these unusual circumstances. This application has been addressed by Memorandum and Order given the comprehensive written submissions, the extremely limited access to in-court proceedings currently, and the Court's judgment that the application did not pose a close question.

On March 23, 2020, Defendant Joseph Meli's parents made a request for bail on their son's behalf. Citing the ongoing public health crisis and Mr. Meli's pre-existing health conditions, his parents requested that he be released from the Manhattan Detention Center (the "MDC") and temporarily placed on home confinement. The Court directed the Government to respond. On March 24, the Government opposed the bail request on the grounds that "even if Meli is bailed by this Court, he must nonetheless remain confined in BOP custody" because he is currently serving a 78 months' sentence in connection with a separate and prior case. See United States v. Simmons et al., No. 17-cr-127 (KMW) (S.D.N.Y.). Although the Court would have given very serious consideration to Mr. Meli's bail application, particularly in light of the public health crisis, the Court agrees with the Government that any decision made by this Court would not render him eligible for release. Mr. Meli is currently detained at the MDC on a writ from Otisville, where he is serving his sentence imposed in the Simmons case. Granting him bail in this matter would thus not change the fact that he is still serving that sentence. For this reason, any request for Mr. Meli's release from BOP custody is properly before the sentencing judge in Simmons. Accordingly, the Court denies Mr. Meli's bail application at this time.

ENDORSEMENT: Application denied. 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c) permits the Court to grant this category of relief "upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or upon motion of the defendant after the defendant has fully exhausted all administrative rights to appeal a failure of the Bureau of Prisons to bring a motion on the defendant's behalf or the lapse of 30 days from the receipt of such a request by the warden of the defendant's facility, whichever is earlier...." 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c) (1)(A). Those statutory preconditions have not been satisfied. Therefore, the Court will not take action with respect to this application. The Court is empathetic to Mr. Estrella's concerns regarding COVID-19, however, the Court sentenced Mr. Estrella to a term of 70 months on January 18, 2019 for substantial reasons--Mr. Estrella was involved in a conspiracy to distribute kilogram quantities of heroin and cocaine in New York City. This request would convert 70 month sentence for that crime into a substantially shorter sentence. The Court anticipates that it will scrutinize any request properly presented to it in accordance with the statute with great care.

Here, Defendant's compromised immune system, taken in concert with the COVID-19 public health crisis, constitutes an extraordinary and compelling reason to modify to Defendant's sentence on the grounds that he is suffering from a serious medical condition that substantially diminishes his ability to provide self-care within the environment of the RCC. U.S.S.G. § 1B1.13, Application Note 1(A). The Court further agrees with the Government that the Defendant does not pose a danger to the safety of any other person or to the community -- particularly since he has been working in the community and visiting his family without issue during his residence at the RCC - - and that a substitution of home incarceration for the remaining four months of Defendant's confinement in the RCC satisfactorily addresses the relevant § 3553(a) factors, particularly in light of his approaching release. It is further ORDERED that Defendant's sentence is modified to replace his outstanding term of imprisonment with an equal period of home incarceration, in addition to the previously-imposed period of supervised release. Specifically, his term of incarceration is amended to conclude forthwith, and his conditions of supervised release are amended to add the condition of home incarceration for what would have been the remainder of his term.

Woods from Attorney Natali Todd dated March 27, 2020 re: Bail Modification. ENDORSEMENT: Application denied without prejudice. The information presented in this letter does not currently justify a modification of the terms of Mr. Acosta's release. The Court requests the views of pre-trial services and the United States regarding this application. The Court also requests additional factual information regarding the rationale for this application. COVID-19 has led many schools to engage in distance learning and to undertake parent-teacher conferences by remote means, yet Mr. Acosta asserts that COVID-19 increases, rather than decreases, his need to leave the home, in particular for educational matters and teacher conferences. In an environment in which many people are being required to limit their mobility, the Court requests additional information regarding why COVID-19 suggests a need to increase that of Mr. Acosta. If this application is renewed, the Court requests a sworn affidavit to support the factual assertions in this letter to establish the stated increased need for Mr. Acosta to leave his home, in particular for his childrens' educational matters and parent-teacher conferences.

The Court's decision in this case is based on, among other things, the unique confluence of serious health issues and other risk factors facing this defendant, including the defendant's age (64 years old), asthma, and high blood pressure, which place him at a substantially heightened risk of dangerous complications should he contract COVID-19 as compared to most other individuals. Accordingly, this Order should not be construed as a determination by this Court that pretrial detention is unsafe or otherwise inappropriate as a general matter or in any other specific case. 2. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i), the Court concludes that compelling reasons exist for temporary release of the defendant from custody during the current public health crisis. Accordingly, the defendant's application is GRANTED pursuant to the following conditions: 3. The Clerk of Court is directed to prepare a personal recognizance bond with the following conditions of release: a. A personal recognizance bond in the amount of $50,000, to be signed by the defendant- b. All mandatory conditions of release included in this Court's standard "Order Setting Conditions of Release" form- c. Home incarceration at a homeless shelter designated by the New York City Department of Homeless Services, with monitoring by means chosen at the discretion of Pretrial Services. The defendant shall be on 24-hour lockdown in the shelter except for emergency medical visits and visits with his attorneys. Any other leave from the shelter must be approved by either the Pretrial Services officer or by the Court on application from defense counsel. d. Pretrial Services supervision as directed by the Pretrial Services Office- e. Surrender all passports and other travel documents and make no applications for new or replacement documents- f. Drug testing and treatment as directed by the Pretrial Services Office- g. The defendant shall not possess a firearm, destructive device, or other weapon- h. The defendant shall not use or possess any narcotic drug or controlled substance unless prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner- i. The defendant shall have no contact whatsoever with any of his codefendants charged in Docket Number 19 Mag. 118 or 19 Cr. 169, including Angela Bosquez, Manolo Dones, Luis Garcia, Joanna Martinez, Alberto Pellot, and Edward Torres- j. The defendant shall be released upon the signature of the defendant on the bond and upon the Pretrial Services Office's installation of the monitoring technology that it selects- and, k. Upon the defendant's release, the defendant must report directly to the intake unit for homeless men operated by the New York City Department of Homeless Services at 400 East 30th Street, New York, New York. 4. The Pretrial Services Office is directed to immediately alert the Court, the Government, and defense counsel of any violation of the above conditions, without need for a formal violation petition. The defendant is hereby notified that violation of the conditions of release will likely result in revocation of this temporary release. 5. Defense counsel is directed to submit a status update letter to the Court once a week after consultation with the Government, informing the Court as to the defendant's status and health. If defense counsel identifies other living arrangements for the defendant, for example, with the defendant's daughters or other family members, defense counsel must notify the Court of that fact in its weekly status update letter to the Court. 6. This Order is subject to modification or revocation by the Court at any time. The Court intends to terminate the defendant's temporary release and return the defendant to pretrial detention as soon as the Court concludes that the defendant no longer faces the acute health risk posed by the current circumstances. 7.

The motion also requests that the Court resentence Mr. Fana to time served under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A) ("Section 3582(c)(1)(A)"). The Court will not rule on this motion ex parte. The Court requests briefing from the United States with respect to this application, and directs that any response be filed no later than April 6, 2020. The Court expects that any briefing will address what the Court understands to be a petition for mandamusto require the BOP to take the requested steps within the time period demanded. Briefing should address whether the BOP has failed to comply with its statutory duties, in light of the language of the cited statutein particular, whether, as Defendant argues, the statute requires the BOP to have made these designation decisions already, such that the BOP can be found to have failed to comply with a statutory obligation. Briefing should also address the Court's authority to order the BOP to comply with the asserted statutory duty. In particular, the Court requests briefing on the effect of 18 U.S.C. § 3621(b) on the Court's authority to order the requested relief. Id. ("Any order, recommendation, or request by a sentencing court that a convicted person serve a term of imprisonment in a community corrections facility shall have no binding effect on the authority of the Bureau under this section to determine or change the place of imprisonment of that person. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a designation of a place of imprisonment under this subsection is not reviewable by any court."). Section 3582(c)(1)(A) permits the Court to modify a term of imprisonment after it has been imposed only "upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or upon motion of the defendant after the defendant has fully exhausted all administrative rights to appeal a failure of the Bureau of Prisons to bring a motion on the defendant's behalf or the lapse of 30 days from the receipt of such a request by the warden of the defendant's facility, whichever is earlier." 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A). While the Court fully appreciates the impact of the national emergency resulting from COVID-19, it is bound by the language of the statute and will not act upon an application under Section 3582(c)(1)(A) unless its express statutory preconditions have been satisfied.

On March 19, defense counsel filed a motion to reconsider my earlier decision denying bail, seeking release due to the imbroglio caused by the outbreak of COVID 19, a viral disease spreading rapidly throughout the five boroughs of New York City, the United States, and the world. Defense counsel claims that the MDC, the federal facility that houses Mr. Escobar, is ill-equipped to protect inmates from the disease, and she asserts that the MDC's recent decision to suspend in-person legal visits prevents Mr. Escobar from assisting his counsel in preparing a defense to the serious drug and gun charges he faces. The motion is based on 18 U.S.C. § 3142 (i). This subsection provides that "The judicial officer may, by subsequent order, permit the temporary release of the person, in the custody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial officer determines such release to be necessary for the preparation of the person's defense or for another compelling reason." 18 U.S.C. § 3142 (i)....[See this Opinion & Order]... Although releasing Mr. Escobar would provide his attorney greater access and flexibility regarding scheduling of telephone or video calls, nothing in counsel's submission suggests that this is necessary. As the government points out, defense counsel may request weekly calls with her client, and she may request more than fifteen minutes per call. Defense counsel has not demonstrated that she has been denied phone calls with Mr. Escobar or extra time per call. Moreover, unlike the situation in Stephens, there is no scheduled evidentiary hearing or trial in this case. The next scheduled conference is simply a status conference at the end of next month. There are no exigencies requiring greater telephonic or video availability for legal visits. The motion for reconsideration is denied. Detention continues. SO ORDERED: (Signed by Judge Andrew L.

On March 27, 2020, the Court held a telephone conference regarding defendant's application pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i) for temporary release from custody during the current Covid-19 pandemic. (ECF No. 93.) The Court has reviewed the governments opposition (ECF No. 94) and defendants replies. (ECF No. 95, 98.)18 U.S.C. § 3142(i) provides that, where a detention order has been issued, a judicial officer may, by subsequent order, permit the temporary release of the person, in the custody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial officer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the persons defense or for another compelling reason. Compelling reasons may exist where the defendants serious medical conditions warrant release. ( See, e.g., United States v. Rebollo-Andino, 312 F. Appx 346, 348 (1st Cir. 2009) (explaining that a defendant who is denied bail retains the ability to request[,]... in extraordinary circumstances,... temporary release under § 3142(i) should future developments with respect to his medical conditions so warrant). Because there is no justifiable reason for the Court to change its prior ruling that, based on the clear and convincing evidence against him, defendant has not overcome the presumption pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3) that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of defendant and the safety of the community, ( see id. at 17:8-20), defendants application is denied.

The current indictment is based on the results of a search, pursuant to a warrant, conducted after a probation officer observed evidence of possible drug dealing during a routine home visit. Following the execution of the search warrant, Falu was charged with possession with intent to distribute mixtures containing cocaine base and methamphetamine and with being a felon in possession of ammunition (fifteen bullets having been found in his room). Falu, who is now 32, first came to the attention of the criminal justice system at age 17. According to the Pretrial Services report, he has four adult convictions including an earlier federal conviction for distribution of oxycodone for which he received a four-year sentence, and most recently he pled guilty to a charge of escape from a re-entry center which followed his incarceration on the oxycodone conviction. He also has been charged with violating his conditions of supervised release as a consequence of the home visit described above. In addition, the Court counts the issuance of six bench warrants in the pretrial report. Given this defendant's history of repeated criminal conduct, defiance of court orders, and disregard for the conditions of release, he cannot meet the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that he will neither flee nor pose a danger to any other person or the community. Fed. R. Cr. P. 32.1 (a)(6). Nor has the defendant made a showing that he is entitled to temporary release given the absence of any medical condition specific to this defendant. This application has been resolved on the basis of the lengthy written submissions given the Court's familiarity with this defendant (having previously denied a bail application) and given the extremely limited access to in-court proceedings. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald on 3/30/2020) (lnl)"

He has been released on bail subject to conditions including home confinement at his home in Miami Beach, Florida, and electronic monitoring. By letter from his counsel, Teman now moves, Dkt. 113, for a modification of the conditions of home confinement, to enable him to attend medical appointments and to shop for food at stores, the latter because Teman reports experiencing difficulty obtaining timely food delivery following Miami Beach's adoption of a safer-at-home order. The Court denies Temans motion for relief as unnecessary. Temans bail conditions already permit him to travel for medical appointments. And as the Government reports in its letter responding to Teman's request, Dkt. 114, Government counsel have confirmed with Temans pretrial services officer that, now notified by the Government of Temans expressed need to leave home to shop for groceries, the officer is prepared to authorize such shopping pursuant to the discretion accorded him by the Court in administering home detention. Temans letter notably had not indicated that, before writing the Court, he or his counsel had raised the need to leave home for food shopping with the pretrial services officer. In the future, should an issue of this nature arise, defense counsel are instructed, before writing the Court, to speak with the pretrial officer to determine whether a genuine controversy exists requiring court resolution.

Furman";"MEMORANDUM & OPINION as to Nkanga Nkanga re: 73 MOTION for Release from Custody : In short, although the rational and right result is for Dr. Nkanga to be temporarily released from custody until circumstances improve, the Court is powerless at this point to bring about that result. The tragedy is that this would not have been the case had Dr. Nkanga pleaded guilty today, instead of last fall, as the Court would plainly have authority to grant him release and would have granted him release under Section 3145(c) based on the "exceptional reasons" posed by COVID-19 and to delay his surrender until the danger had passed. Nor would it have been the case had the Court fully appreciated the dangers of COVID-19 on March 12, 2020, when Dr. Nkanga was sentenced. If the Court (or counsel) had fully anticipated the circumstances that now exist, the Court likely would have adjourned Dr. Nkanga's sentencing until after the danger had passed and granted his release under Section 3145(c) in the interim. But as a result of the relative timing of these events, the Court is now deprived of the power to grant Dr. Nkanga the relief he seeks. And, thus, Dr. Nkanga faces weeks, if not months, in purgatory or worse at the MDC before he can be transferred to a medical facility that is more appropriate for his conditions and more likely to keep him safe from COVID-19. Dr. Nkanga's case is a vivid illustration of why the dangers posed by COVID-19 to the imprisoned population cry out for action by Congress and the Executive Branch. For the most part, judges are limited to granting release in individual cases an approach that is too slow and ad hoc to do much good against the unprecedented dangers posed by COVID-19. Moreover, as Dr. Nkanga's case makes plain, Congress has given judges only limited tools, and there are many inmates certainly those such as Dr. Nkanga who have just been sentenced, and potentially the vast majority of inmates serving sentences previously imposed for whom judicial relief under current law may be unavailable.4 Only the political branches can do what this moment requires. The question is whether they will do so and, if they do, whether their actions will be too late for Dr. Nkanga and other inmates like him.

In his submission, Mendez argues that his sentence should be vacated because he was found guilty of a crime he was not charged with and his written sentence differed from his oral sentence. Although he purports to seek relief because the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and new evidence has been discovered, his request is essentially a § 2255 motion.

This proposal does not do that. The Court hopes that counsel will take the initiative to propose an order that the Court might be reasonably expected to sign, compliant with the statutory requirements.

"1:19-cr-00131-PAE";"USA v. Randall et al";"03/31/2020";"order";"Order on Letter Motion";"366  ";"Paul A. Engelmayer";"ORDER as to Dwayne Anthony Conley (3): Defendant Dwayne Anthony Conley is presently held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC"), awaiting trial on charges of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1594(c)- sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a)- and witness tampering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b). By letter, Conley now moves for release on conditions of bail, noting that the MCC has identified him as an inmate who, on account of a number of multiple medical conditions, is at heightened risk from COVID-19. Dkt. 363. The Government opposes this application. Dkt. 364. Conley has submitted a reply. Dkt. 365. The Court has the legal authority to grant this relief, under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i), which permits the temporary pretrial release of a defendant otherwise requiring detention into the custody of a U.S. marshal or other designated person. This Court and others have done so in appropriate cases. See, e.g., United States v. Perez, No. 19 Cr. 297 (PAE), 2020 WL 1329225, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 19, 2020) (granting bail application of 65-year-old defendant with COPD, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i), in light of "unique confluence of serious health issues and other risk factors facing this defendant,... which place him at a substantially heightened risk of dangerous complications should [he] contract COVID-19"). The Court, however, declines to exercise its discretion to do so in Conley's case. Substantially for the reasons recited in the Government's letter, the Court regards Conley as presenting far too great a danger to the community to justify his release. That is so based on (1) the gravity of the sex-trafficking offenses (substantive and conspiratorial) with which Conley stands charged, which subject him to a potential 15-year mandatory minimum sentence, and the Government's proffer of the alarming conduct underlying those charges- (2) Conley's criminal history, which includes nine arrests and five convictions (three for felonies) dating back to 1987- and (3) as alleged in the superseding indictment, Conley's alleged commissionfrom the MCCof an act of felony witness tampering in this case. Simply put, the danger to the community presented by Conley's release outweighs, substantially, the danger to himself presented by his incarceration at the MCC. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motion pending at docket 363. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Paul A. Engelmayer on 3/31/2020) (lnl)"

Because, both of Mr. Thomas' previous lawyers, Dale Smith and Kye Walker, have represented to the Court that they have produced the entirety of their case files to Mr. Thomas, this motion is denied as moot. Furthermore, the Court denies Mr. Thomas' motion for discovery. Discovery on a 2255 habeas petition is only allowed when the movant has shown "good cause." See Rule 6(a), Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings. Much of what Mr. Thomas seeks is either publicly available or produced in discovery to Mr. Thomas' former counsel who have now in turn produced it to Mr. Thomas. The remainder of Mr. Thomas' discovery requests are either not germane to his claims or unsupported. Mr. Thomas seeks privileged materials from his co-defendants, Mr. Parrilla and Mr. Tang Yuk, particularly with regard to severance. However, Mr. Thomas does not directly challenge the denial of severance in his petition and this privileged material from Mr. Parrilla and Mr. Tang Yuk would not bear on any of his other claims, such as his Strickland claim. Mr. Thomas also seeks affirmations from the Government with respect to its surveillance activities pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3504. However, the Government represents that it has already complied with all of its discovery obligations, including those under Brady, with respect to surveillance. Therefore, Mr. Thomas' § 3504 demand is denied. See United States v. Aref, 285 F. App'x 784, 793 (2d Cir. 2008). Mr. Thomas has not shown the requisite good cause to receive discovery on his 2255 habeas petition. His motion is denied. Respondent is hereby ordered to mail a copy of this Order to Movant. If it is impracticable for Respondent to mail a copy of this Order, then Respondent should notify the Court within three days of the date of this Order, so the Court can implement an alternative procedure.
