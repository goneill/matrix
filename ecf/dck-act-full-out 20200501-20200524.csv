Caproni";"MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Emanuel Falconer on 247 LETTER by Emanuel Falconer addressed to Judge Valerie E. Caproni from Emanuel Falconer, dated 4/22/2020, re: Compassionate Release. ENDORSEMENT: The Court views Mr. Falconer's request as a motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1). Mr. Falconer's efforts towards obtaining a GED and his participation in BOP programs are commendable, and the Court continues to encourage those positive steps. Mr. Falconer's ability to remain incident-free is also worthy of praise. Similarly, the Court is sympathetic to Mr. Falconer's desire to be with his family during these times. Nevertheless, the Court's authority to grant relief pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1) is narrow. First, Mr. Falconer must exhaust his administrative remedies by making a request to BOP for compassionate release before making an application to the Court- the exhaustion requirement is satisfied if BOP fails to take action within 30 days of the request. See 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1) (a). Even assuming that the exhaustion requirement can be waived, the circumstances in the letter are not sufficiently exigent as to justify a waiver of a statutory requirement that expires within 30 days. Finally, relief can only be granted pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1) if Mr. Falconer identifies "extraordinary and compelling reasons." Mr. Falconer's present circumstances do not constitute "extraordinary" reasons because he does not face a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to other inmates, and his separation from his loved ones is a reality shared by virtually all other prisoners. Mr. Falconer's request for a sentencing reduction must therefore be denied. A copy of this Order has been mailed to Mr. Falconer by chambers staff. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Valerie E.

See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i).

That statute contains an explicit exhaustion requirement: "[T]he court, upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or upon motion of the defendant after the defendant has fully exhausted all administrative rights to appeal a failure of the Bureau of Prisons to bring a motion on the defendant's behalf or the lapse of 30 days from the receipt of such a request by the warden of the defendants facility, whichever is earlier, may reduce the term of imprisonment... if it finds that... extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a reduction." Defendant concedes he did not fully exhaust his administrative remedies under Section 3582 prior to filing the instant motion. The Court does not have the power to waive that requirement. See, e.g., United States v. Roberts, 2020 WL 1700032 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2020).

Before the Court is an emergency motion by Defendant Enrique Rivera a/k/a Eulogio Portes ("Portes") for a sentence reduction to time served and his immediate release from the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn ("the MDC"), or, in the alternative, for immediate transfer to home confinement, due to Portes's advanced age, compromised health, and his status as a medically "high-risk" inmate who is especially vulnerable to contracting the Coronavirus, COVID-19 ("COVID-19"). Portes brings the motion pursuant to the First Step Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A) ("the Act"), commonly known as the compassionate release statute. The Government opposes Portes's motion as procedurally barred because he did not satisfy the Act's administrative exhaustion requirements before seeking judicial intervention, and substantively meritless because Portes's preexisting medical conditions, while serious, do not justify a reduction to the already lenient sentence the Court imposed less than three months ago. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that Portes is not entitled to relief pursuant to the Act because the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c), which became effective on November 1, 1987, do not apply to his term of incarceration, which was imposed for criminal conduct that occurred prior to that date. However, Portes's motion is GRANTED pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b), in effect prior to amendment by Public Law 98-473 and applicable to offenses committed prior to November 1, 1987. Accordingly, Portes is to be released from the MDC tomorrow, May 2, 2020, and he is to immediately begin serving the remaining 138 days of his original sentence in home confinement, after first undergoing a 14-day quarantine, both of which must take place at the locations designated in Portes's April 23, 2020 letter to the Court. (See Letter from John M. Hillebrecht, DLA Piper LLP (US), to Hon. John F. Keenan (Apr. 23, 2020), ECF No. 72.)...[See this Opinion & Order]... III. Order: In view of the above, it is hereby ORDERED that Enrique Rivera a/k/a Eulogio Portes, Register Number 17330-054, is RESENTENCED to TIME SERVED plus 138 days of probation, which must be served in home confinement and monitored by such technology and on such conditions as the U.S. Probation Department for the Southern District of New York deems appropriate. It is FURTHER ORDERED that the following additional terms of Portes's probation are hereby imposed: 1. Portes must call his Probation Officer the day he is released, and he must strictly follow any instructions he receives at that time or in subsequent conversations. 2. Portes must call the New York State 24-Hour Coronavirus Hotline (1-888-364-3065) the day he is released, and he must strictly follow the medical and social distancing advice he receives. 3.Portes must strictly self-isolate from others at the Haverhill, Massachusetts location designated in his April 23, 2020 letter, (ECF No. 72), until at least May 17, 2020. 4.Immediately upon completion of the 14-day quarantine,Portes must reside at the Lynn, Massachusetts location designated in his April 23, 2020 letter, (ECF No. 72), until at least September 17, 2020. It is FURTHER ORDERED that Enrique Rivera a/k/a Eulogio Portes, Register Number 17330-054, be released from the MDC tomorrow, May 2, 2020. IV. Conclusion: For the reasons set forth above, Portes's motion for reduction in sentence or home confinement pursuant to the First Step Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), is DENIED. However, Portes's motion is GRANTED pursuant to former Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b). SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge John F. Keenan on 5/1/2020)(bw)"

Nonetheless, his release date has not been set- but FCI Fort Dix has recommended that he be released on May 8, i.e., one week from today. The Court urges the BOP to promptly set a firm release date, and to allow the defendant to commence home confinement as soon as it is practical and safe for him to do so. Nevertheless, because the administrative process is proceeding in what appears to be a positive direction, the instant motion is denied as moot, without prejudice to renewal if the defendant is not released by May 8.

Rather, the Second Circuit dismissed those appeals on January 15, 2020. In particular, the Second Circuit dismissed Lasher's appeal from our Protective Order of June 3, 2019 for the lack of an arguable basis either in law or in fact. Given the dismissal ofher appeal, the Court finds no reason to hold a hearing to reconsider the merits of our June 3, 2019 Protective Order.

Defendant pled guilty to bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1344, and to wire fraud,in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343. (PSR 5- Dkt. Nos. 13, 14) He was sentenced to 120 months' imprisonment (Dkt. No. 16), and his release date is April 17, 2022. (Dkt. No. 50 at 2) On April 15, 2020, Defendant submitted a written request to the warden of his institution asking that he be released pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A). (Id. at 7) The Government contends that Defendant has not exhausted his administrative remedies and that exhaustion is mandatory. (Dkt. No. 50) Even if this Court were to reject the Government's exhaustion arguments, Defendants application would fail on the merits. Defendant is 33 years old and has no medical conditions that make him particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus. (PSR 104) Only one inmate at his institution has tested positive for the virus. (Dkt. No. 50 at 4 n.4) Defendants fear of contracting COVID-19 in prison standing alone is not an "extraordinary and compelling" reason justifying his release. See United States v. Simmons, No. 15 CR. 445 (PAE), 2020 WL 1847863, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 13, 2020) (denying compassionate release where defendant "does not fit into any heightened risk category for COVID-19").

While Defendant's asthma presents a degree of greater risk to Defendant in the event that he contracts COVID-19, that risk is not outweighed by the significant danger that Defendant's release would pose. This conclusion is based primarily on (1) the nature and seriousness of the charges in this case and the strength of the evidence, (2) the evidence that Defendant has been directly involved in shootings, and (3) the Defendant's serious and violent criminal history. "Simply put, the danger to the community presented by [Defendant's] release outweighs, substantially, the danger to himself presented by his incarceration."

Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic presently striking the Nation and the City of New York, Woodson argues that he has an enhanced risk of contracting COVID-19 at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) where he is currently incarcerated and, were he to contract the disease, his preexisting conditions would make it life-threatening to him.

The Court certifies under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(3) that any appeal from this order would not be taken in good faith, and therefore in forma pauperis status is denied for the purpose of an appeal.

Chan dated May 4, 2020 re: On March 16, 2020, the Court ordered the unsealing of Defendant Dajahn Mcbean's monthly supervision reports from November 2018 and December 2018 (the "March 16 Unsealing Order"), which was maintained under seal at the request of the Government in light of an ongoing law enforcement investigation, which had not yet been publicly disclosed. On April 21, 2020, the Court granted the Government's request to keep the March 16 Unsealing Order under seal for an additional 30 days (the "April 21 Unsealing Order"). On May 1, 2020, an indictment was unsealed charging the defendant and others with bank fraud conspiracy and aggravated identity theft. See United States v. Dajahn McBean and William Valdez, 20 Cr. 226 (KPF). As a result, the Government respectfully submits that continued sealing of the March 16 Unsealing Order and the April 21 Unsealing Order, as well as the ex parte applications by the Government in support of those orders, is no longer necessary. The Government further requests that these orders and applications be filed on the public docket. ENDORSEMENT: Given the government's representation that sealing of the documents identified herein is no longer necessary, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the government is directed to file the ex parte applications previously submitted under seal on the public docket.

Medre et al";"05/05/2020";"order";"Order on Motion to Reduce Sentence";"275  ";"Cathy Seibel";"ORDER denying 272 Motion to Reduce Sentence as to Antonious Samuel (3): Under 18 USC 3582(c)(1)(a), I may, after considering the factors set forth in 18 USC 3553(a), reduce a sentence if extraordinary and compelling reasons justify such action and it is consistent with the relevant policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. Policy Statement 1B1.13 imposes similar requirements, along with the provision that the Defendant not be a danger to the safety of any other person or the community. Application Note 1 to Policy Statement 1B1.13 describes four potential extraordinary and compelling reasons: 1) the defendant has a terminal medical condition or because of such a health condition is substantially diminished in his ability to provide self-care- 2) the defendant is at least 65 years old and has served 75% of his sentence- 3) family circumstances- and 4) an extraordinary and compelling reason other than or in combination with one of the above. It is not clear whether Mr. Samuels has exhausted his administrative remedies. He says he applied for compassionate release on 4/4/20 and thus thirty days have run. The Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") says he did not apply until 4/22/20. I will assume for the sake of argument that Mr. Samuels has exhausted. Defendant suggests that he meets the fourth category listed above (extraordinary and compelling reason other than or in combination with one listed) because he has two medical conditions -- asthma and obesity -- that put him at increased risk should he be stricken with COVID-19. While his asthma appears to be mild and well controlled, given that his medical records apparently reflect that he rarely uses his inhaler, I will assume that the combination of factors he posits do put him at increased risk for serious illness should he contract the virus. The risk to him is less extraordinary and compelling than it would be were he housed at a different facility, because it seems there are no staff or inmate cases of the virus at FCI Schuylkill, although that could of course change. In any event, I still must balance the extraordinary and compelling reason Mr. Samuels posits against the factors set forth in 18 USC 3553(a). See USA v. Daugerdas, 2020 WL 2097653 (S.D.N.Y. 5/1/20). Those factors weigh against release. Mr. Samuels was sentenced to 60-months for managing a high-end cocaine operation, a role he took over after the original leader was charged with federal narcotics offenses. Mr. Samuels not only ran the business -- including obtaining supply, hiring workers and arranging sales -- but he funneled proceeds to his predecessor. His sentence of 60 months was appropriate, considering the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the Defendant, and the other 3553(a) factors. It would undermine several of those factors to release Mr. Samuels now, when he has served only about one-third of his sentence. Such a substantial reduction would have Mr. Samuels serving a sentence that is not just punishment. It would diminish respect for the law for an offender to get such a large reduction essentially because he is obese, and it would introduce unwarranted sentencing disparity. See Daugerdas. The Court believes, however, that Mr. Samuels' health could be safeguarded without undermining the 3553(a) factors by a temporary furlough under 18 USC 3622. Only BOP can order such a furlough, but the Court recommends that BOP give serious consideration to temporary release for Mr. Samuels, under proper conditions, after which he would complete his sentence. While Mr. Samuels' continuing the cocaine business after his boss was charged suggests he could be a danger to the community, he did not revert to criminal conduct while on pretrial release and the Court believes that he does not otherwise present a danger. (The Court notes that the community to which Mr. Samuels would be released -- Yonkers, New York -- has experienced a high level of corona virus infections, so suitable quarantine arrangements would have to be made.) A temporary furlough, rather than a sentence reduction, strikes the Court as the most fair and sensible balance of both the public interest and the risk to Mr. Samuels. The Government is directed to send a copy of this text order to the Warden and the legal department at FCI Schuylkill.. (Signed by Judge Cathy Seibel on 05/05/2020) (Seibel, Cathy)"

ENDORSEMENT: The Court is in receipt of the government's request for "any and all" of Defendant's monthly supervision reports to his probation officer. Having reviewed the reports, each of which is roughly one page long, the Court grants the request as to the monthly supervision reports for the months of November 2018 and December 2018 only.

Mr. Mena has not exhausted his administrative remedies and thus the Court could not grant the application even if it wanted to. See USA v. Roberts, 2020 WL 1700032 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2020). But even if he had exhausted, I would not grant the motion. Mr. Mena has not shown extraordinary and compelling circumstances under 18 USC 3582(c)(1)(A)(i), USSG 1B1.13 and Application Note 1 to USSG 1B1.13. He points only to the existence of the corona virus pandemic and the possibility he could be infected while incarcerated. This unfortunate fact -- which affects every prisoner -- does not alone suffice. He has pointed to no medical condition that puts him at elevated risk, and his facility is, at least for now, COVID-19-free. Finally, the factors under 18 USC 3553(a) militate strongly in favor of keeping Mr. Mena incarcerated. He has not served even half of his sentence- he has a serious criminal history- and he sold guns and heroin. His track record (including committing the instant offense while on federal supervised release and lying in his application under 28 USC 2255) makes it unlikely he would be law-abiding if released. The substantial sentence reduction Mr. Mena seeks, in the absence of specific peril to him from the virus, would undermine respect for the law, create unwarranted disparities, reduce deterrence and endanger the public. Accordingly, the application is denied. The Government shall send a copy of this text order to Mr. Mena and file a certificate of service or its equivalent on the docket (or advise my courtroom deputy if unable to do so)..

Dear Counsel: I am a Senior United States District Judge and the trial judge in the captioned case. I write this e-mail from my home in ########, rather than my chambers in New Haven (where I am presently posted, in the D. Ct.), because the courthouse is effectively shut down owing to the virus. As your files will reflect, Defendants Rodriguez and Camacho are currently scheduled to be re-sentenced, following the Court's vacating of their original convictions and sentences under section 924(c). Virus-related restrictions make it necessary to conduct the necessary re-sentencing hearings by means of telephone conferences. I am told that Rodriguez's hearing is scheduled for 11 a.m. on May 7. Camacho's hearing is scheduled for 1:00 p.m. on that day. I will be telephoning from home In order to participate in and preside over those hearings. I need to be given the number or numbers I must use to join the conference. Please e-mail those numbers to me at the above e-mail address: #########.com. Arrangements must be made to have a court reporter participate in the telephone conference so that a transcript of the hearing is made. During each hearing, I will hear, first, from counsel for the Government, then from counsel for the Defendant, and then from the Defendant himself (if he wishes to be heard). Counsel for the parties may then respond, if so advised. The Court will re-sentence Defendants after considering the entire record and all that has been said at the hearings. The transcripts of the hearings should be ordered on an expedited basis, the Government to bear the cost. Conducting a sentencing hearing in this way is not ideal, but the circumstances require it, and with the care and good will of all concerned, the cause of justice will be served. Every participant at the hearings should be sure to introduce themselves before speaking, and thereafter speak loudly and somewhat more slowly than they would ordinarily. I ask for this in order that everyone at the hearing hears everything that everyone else says, and an accurate transcript of the proceeding will be achieved. AT & T Conference Call number: (888) 363 4749. Access Code - 5216477. This e-mail should be understood as an Order of the Court. It will be docketed as such.

Gardephe from Eric Jamel LeSane dated [Not Dated] re: COVID-19. ENDORSEMENT: The application is denied. Lesane pled guilty to felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g) (Dkt. Nos. 8, 62), and was sentenced to 94 months' imprisonment (Dkt. No. 28, 62). His release date is January 3, 2021. (Dkt. No. 67 at 2) To the extent that Lesane seeks release to home confinement under 18 U.S.C. § 3624(c)(2), the Court lacks jurisdiction to issue such relief. See United States v. Engleson, No. 13-CR-340-3 (RJS), 2020 WL 1821797, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 10, 2020) (the "decision of whether to release an inmate to home confinement rests with the BOP"). To the extent that Lesane seeks compassionate release under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), the Government contends that he has not exhausted his administrative remedies and that exhaustion is mandatory. (Dkt. No. 67 at 5-7) Even if this Court were to reject the Government's exhaustion arguments, Lesane's application would fail on the merits. Although Lesane has a history of asthma (Id. at 8 n.3), the Bureau of Prisons represents that no inmates or staff members have tested positive for COVID-19 at FCI-Pekin, where Lesane is housed. (Id. at 2) Lesane also presents a significant danger to the community. He has a lengthy criminal record that includes numerous acts of violence and the possession of weapons. (PSR 28-56) The instant offense involves possession of a nine mm. Luger firearm with a defaced serial number. Lesane has not been susceptible to community supervision in the past (see id. 37) and, while incarcerated, he has had multiple serious disciplinary infractions, including for possessing a dangerous weapon and assaulting another inmate.

The Court has determined, in the interest of due care, to review itself the transcripts of the grand jury proceedings in this case, to enable the Court independently to assess Teman's contention that the theory of liability with respect to these checks pursued at trial departed from that presented to the grand jury. For avoidance of doubt, the Court's review of the grand jury transcripts will be in camera and ex parte. The grand jury transcripts are not to be supplied to the defense, which has not provided sufficient justification for defense access to these materials. The Court's decision resolving Teman's motion will address these matters further. The Government is therefore directed to provide the Court with the grand jury transcripts by May 8, 2020.

Before the Court is an emergency motion by Ramesh Seshan for a sentence reduction to time served and his immediate release from the Federal Medical Center, Devens in Ayer, Massachusetts ("FMC Devens"), or, in the alternative, for immediate transfer to home confinement, due to Seshan's serious underlying health issues, including his end-stage renal failure requiring dialysis, and the threat he faces from the Coronavirus, COVID-19 ("COVID-19"). The Government opposes Seshan's motion as procedurally barred because his earlier petition under the applicable statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i), which was filed in July 2019, did not raise COVID-19 as a justification for compassionate release, and substantively meritless because Seshan's preexisting medical conditions, the circumstances of his incarceration, and the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) sentencing factors do not warrant a modification to his term of imprisonment. For the reasons set forth below, Seshan's motion is DENIED....[See this Opinion & Order]... III.

If he means to move under 18 USC 3624(c) to serve the remainder of his sentence on home confinement, that relief can be granted by the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP"), not the court, so Mr. Caraballo should apply to BOP. Likewise, if Mr. Caraballo is seeking a temporary furlough under 18 USC 3622, he should apply to BOP. I will construe Mr. Caraballo's letter as an application for reduction of sentence (known as "compassionate release") under 18 USC 3582(c)(1)(A). For the reasons stated in USA v. Roberts, 2020 WL 1700032 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2020), such applications may be made to the sentencing judge only after administrative remedies within BOP are exhausted or after 30 days have passed without a positive response from BOP.

Amaro : The Court is in receipt of Defendant Rasheen Amaro's request that the Court recommend to the Bureau of Prisons (the "BOP") that he "be released to home confinement to complete the last seven months of his 40-month sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3624(c), as amended by Section 12003(b)(2) of the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act." (Dkt. #38). The Government has indicated that it takes no position with respect to the request. (Dkt. #39). The Court has reviewed the request and the remainder of Mr. Amaro's docket. It is concerned that certain of Mr. Amaro's medical conditions may place him at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19, or of experiencing more severe medical consequences if he were to contract the virus. By the same token, the Court recalls the egregiousness of Mr. Amaro's criminal conduct, and worries about the possibility that he may revert to this behavior were he to be released early to home confinement. The Court resolves these competing concerns in the following manner: It will make the requested recommendation to BOP, but it does so on one condition. That condition is that, if the BOP determines to release Mr. Amaro, prior to his actual release, defense counsel arranges a telephonic conference or conferences between the family members with whom Mr. Amaro would be residing during his period of home confinement and the Probation Office. This conference or conferences would either supplement or take the place of the home inspection that is customarily undertaken preliminary to placement of a defendant in home confinement, and would address issues that include, but are not limited to, the conditions of supervised release- the means by which Mr. Amaro will receive medical and or mental health services while on home confinement- the contemplated living arrangements- and Mr. Amaro's ability to access technology. The Court understands from the Probation Office that such a conference can be conducted telephonically, and, further, that it can be conducted while Mr. Amaro awaits resolution of his request to the BOP. The Court will issue its recommendation under separate cover. The unredacted version of Mr. Amaro's application will be filed under seal. SO ORDERED.

Adames et al.";"05/08/2020";"order";"Order on Motion for Miscellaneous Relief";"151  ";"Cathy Seibel";"ORDER denying 148 Motion for compassionate release as to Pervis Marcus (6): Defendant Marcus has moved for reduction of sentence (often referred to as "compassionate release"). Under 18 USC 3582(c)(1)(a), I may, after considering the factors set forth in 18 USC 3553(a), reduce a sentence if extraordinary and compelling reasons justify such action and it is consistent with the relevant policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. Policy Statement 1B1.13 imposes similar requirements, along with the provision that the Defendant not be a danger to the safety of any other person or the community. Application Note 1 to Policy Statement 1B1.13 describes four potential extraordinary and compelling reasons: 1) the defendant has a terminal medical condition or because of such a health condition is substantially diminished in his ability to provide self-care- 2) the defendant is at least 65 years old and has served 75% of his sentence- 3) family circumstances- and 4) an extraordinary and compelling reason other than or in combination with one of the above. (It is not the law, as the Government suggests, that a diminished ability to provide self-care is required.)It is not clear whether Mr. Marcus has exhausted his administrative remedies. It appears from his lawyer's communications with the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") that he requested to serve the remainder of his sentence under home confinement pursuant to 18 USC 3624(c), not a sentence reduction under 18 USC 3582(c)(1). But the Government can waive a failure to exhaust, see USA v. Roberts, 2002 WL 1700032 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2020), and I find it has done so by its concession that Mr. Marcus has properly exhausted.Turning to the merits, Defendant suggests that he meets the fourth category listed above (extraordinary and compelling reason other than or in combination with one listed) because he has medical conditions that put him at increased risk should he be stricken with COVID-19. He has a documented history of diabetes, which according to the CDC is a risk factor. He also has a documented history of asthma, which according to the CDC is a risk factor if it is moderate to severe. He has not provided medical opinion as to whether his case is mild, moderate or severe, but I infer it is is at least moderate from the fact that he has two medications and needs daily puffs from his inhaler. (Mr. Marcus also has other medical conditions but they do not seem relevant to COVID-19.) Mr. Marcus appears to be receiving appropriate medical attention at the Metropolitan Detention Center ("MDC")-- where he is housed only because he got stuck there during a transfer -- but this combination of conditions puts Mr. Marcus at increased risk for serious illness should he contract the virus, and the conditions at MDC do not allow for the social distancing and other measures necessary to safeguard against contracting COVID-19. I find that Mr. Marcus' medical condition, combined with the risks incarcerated persons face at MDC, present an extraordinary and compelling reason with the meaning of 18 USC 3582(c)(1)(A).I still must balance that extraordinary and compelling reason against the factors set forth in 18 USC 3553(a). See USA v. Daugerdas, 2020 WL 2097653 (S.D.N.Y. 5/1/20). Those factors weigh against release. Mr. Marcus was part of a cocaine and crack distribution organization. He sold cocaine to his customers and cooked cocaine into crack for others. He had 11 prior convictions, mostly for drug offenses, and he went right back to drug dealing even after being arrested on state charges during the conspiracy. His Sentencing Guidelines range as calculated by Probation was 78-97 months. In his plea agreement he stipulated to a range of 63-78 months. Because of mitigating factors in his background, including childhood trauma and a long history of addiction, the Court sentenced him to 48 months, well below his Guidelines. That sentence was appropriate, considering the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the Defendant, and the other 3553(a) factors. It would undermine several of those factors to release Mr. Samuels now, when he has served only about eighteen months of that sentence. Such a substantial reduction would have Mr. Samuels serving a sentence that is not just punishment. It would diminish respect for the law for an offender with such a history to get such a large reduction. It would introduce unwarranted sentencing disparity. And it would inadequately protect the public against further crimes. See generally Daugerdas. Further, given Mr. Marcus' history, which shows him eventually lapsing back into drug use and therefore criminal activity, the Court lacks confidence that he would be law-abiding for any length of time upon release, and thus he would present a danger to the community were his sentence to be reduced. The Court believes, however, that Mr. Marcus's health could be safeguarded without undermining the 3553(a) factors by one of two actions. One would be to get Mr. Marcus out of MDC and into a facility where better social distancing and isolation are possible. Another would be a temporary furlough under 18 USC 3622. Only BOP can order such a furlough, but the Court recommends that BOP give serious consideration to temporary release for Mr. Marcus, under proper conditions, after which he would complete his sentence. A transfer to a different facility, or a temporary furlough, rather than a sentence reduction, would strike the most fair and sensible balance of both the public interest and the risk to Mr. Marcus.

Londonio et al";"05/10/2020";"order-cr";"Order";"1014  ";"Cathy Seibel";"ORDER as to Tindaro Corso: Defendant Tindaro Corso has made a motion for sentence reduction (known as "compassionate release"). His counsel has made several filings by email but not ECF, and the Government has responded in kind. Both parties are directed to file on ECF redacted versions of their submissions, omitting information that is too personal, and to provide unredacted hard copies to chambers for filing under seal.Under 18 USC 3582(c), I may, after considering the factors set forth in 18 USC 3553(a), reduce a sentence if extraordinary and compelling reasons justify such action and it is consistent with the relevant policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. Policy Statement 1B1.13 imposes similar requirements, along with the provision that the Defendant not be a danger to the safety of any other person or the community. Application Note 1 to Policy Statement 1B1.13 describes four potential extraordinary and compelling reasons: 1) the defendant has a terminal medical condition or because of such a health condition is substantially diminished in his ability to provide self-care- 2) the defendant is at least 65 years old and has served 75% of his sentence- 3) family circumstances- and 4) an extraordinary and compelling reason other than or in combination with one of the above. Defendant does not suggest he meets any of the first three categories, but argues that the risk the corona virus pandemic poses to one with his health conditions meets the fourth category. According to his Presentence Report, he suffers from high blood pressure, high cholesterol and reflux, and had an unexplained fainting spell. His Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") medical records show that he has high blood pressure, asthma and sleep apnea- suffers from post-polio syndrome which makes one of his legs weak- has had two more fainting episodes, which remain unexplained but which his providers speculate might be a consequence of post-polio syndrome and which he believes are caused by high blood pressure- and had a respiratory infection on 3/31/20 that had resolved by 4/21/20. The CDC lists moderate to severe asthma as factor that puts one at increased risk for a severe case if one contracts COVID-19, but there is no indication that Defendant's case is moderate to severe- indeed, it appears mild as he apparently does not use his inhaler daily. None of his other conditions appear on the CDC list of risk factors. He is 59 years old. He is housed at FCI Fort Dix, where he has been receiving regular and apparently adequate medical attention, but where social distancing and other measures needed to avoid COVID-19 cannot be regularly undertaken. All inmate cases of COVID-19 at Fort Dix, however, are in the camp, not the prison where Defendant is housed, although that could of course change.I do not find that Defendant has shown extraordinary and compelling circumstances. While he has a myriad of health problems, some serious, they do not appear to correspond to the COVID-19 risk factors, and the facility where he is housed does not appear to have an outbreak.Further, even if I were to assume he had met the threshold of extraordinary and compelling circumstances, the 3553(a) factors militate against release. Defendant has served less than 8 months of his 30 month sentence. He is a lifelong member of organized crime, which by definition means he swore an oath of loyalty to the Lucchese Family, and he rose to the level of Acting Captain in that Family. He was convicted of conspiring to use extortionate means to collect extensions of credit from 2008-2017. While he was not accused of personally committing acts of violence, he profited from the Family's deserved reputation for violence and profited from the willingness of his subordinates to use violence. I have no confidence that if he were released for any length of time, he would not return to his former associations, and he thus presents a danger to the community. His original sentence was justified by th 3553(a) factors, and releasing him after only 8 months under these circumstances would discount the nature and seriousness of the offense and the history and characteristics of the Defendant- would not be just punishment- would not protect the public- and would introduce unwarranted sentencing disparities.Accordingly, the motion is denied. Defendant may wish to ask BOP for a temporary furlough, after which he would complete his sentence, if his pulmonary health is in fact worse than has been shown on this motion.

The Court notes that the sentencing in this case was originally scheduled for October 4, 2019, and has been rescheduled several times since then, initially because defendant requested the appointment of new counsel, which request was granted (Doc. #398), and also because defendant's new counsel, Guy Oksenhendler, Esq., has requested three adjournments. (Docs. ##407, 421, 431). The Court has recently received two letters from defendant claiming that his attorney has not been sufficiently attentive to his case (Docs. ##432, 437), and the Court has also been contacted by the expert/mitigation specialist retained by defense counsel (as authorized by the Court) who has also expressed concern about defense counsel's attention to the case. The Court wishes to remind counsel that the re-sentencing in this case will go forward on June 5, 2020. As previously ordered, defendant's sentencing submission is due May 22, 2020, and the government's submission is due May 29, 2020. No further adjournments will be granted, also as previously ordered. By no later than May 29, 2020, defense counsel shall consult with his client and advise the Court in writing whether defendant will waive his right to be physically present and consent to appearing by video or teleconference.

In light of the ongoing national emergency arising from the COVID-19 Pandemic, its continuing material impact on the functioning of the federal courts, the increasing necessity for judges in this District to conduct criminal proceedings remotely in order to comply with social distancing protocol, and the parties' desire to reach a disposition as expeditiously as possible, the Court finds that a plea hearing in this matter cannot be further delayed without serious harm to the interests of justice. Accordingly, this matter is referred to the duty Magistrate Judge for the limited purpose of conducting a plea hearing by video conference, or if video conferencing is not reasonably available, by telephone conference. Such hearing should be scheduled within the next two weeks, if reasonably possible, to allow the parties to prepare the necessary paperwork.

The Government is to file its opposition to any substantive motions by August 7, 2020. 3. Any replies are to be filed by August 19, 2020. 4. If necessary, the Court will schedule a hearing in a separate order. 5. The Government shall produce any 404(b) evidence to defendants by August 14, 2020. 6.

Since this adjournment is necessary to allow time for counsel to prepare for trial, the Court excludes the time from June 15, 2020 until October 15, 2020 from Speedy Trial Act calculation. This Court finds that this continuance serves to ensure the effective assistance of counsel and to prevent any miscarriage of justice. Additionally, this Court find that the ends of justice served by such a continuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendants in a speedy trial pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h) (8)(a).

The Court has no authority under Section 3624(c) to order the early release of a sentenced defendant. See, e.g., United States v. Ogarro, 2020 WL 1876300, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 14, 2020)- United States v. Rodriguez, 2020 WL 1866040, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 14, 2020). Accordingly, to the extent the motion seeks any relief under that statute, the motion is DENIED. Defendant may wish to address any such request to the Warden at his facility and/or to the Bureau of Prisons. Section 3582(c)(1)(A) contains an explicit exhaustion requirement: "[T]he court, upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or upon motion of the defendant after the defendant has fully exhausted all administrative rights to appeal a failure of the Bureau of Prisons to bring a motion on the defendant's behalf or the lapse of 30 days from the receipt of such a request by the warden of the defendant's facility, whichever is earlier, may reduce the term of imprisonment... if it finds that... extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a reduction." Defendant does not claim he made any effort to exhaust his administrative remedies under Section 3582(c)(1)(A) prior to submitting the instant motion. The Court does not have the power to waive that requirement. See, e.g., United States v. Ogarro, 2020 WL 1876300, at *3-5- United States v. Roberts, 2020 WL 1700032, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2020). By May 18, 2020, the government shall advise the Court in writing whether it is willing to waive Section 3582(c)(1)(A)'s exhaustion requirement in this case. If the government is not willing to waive, the Court will deny the Section 3582(c) (1)(A) motion without prejudice to re-filing after the exhaustion requirement has been satisfied.

Furman";"ORDER 59 LETTER MOTION The Court has received the parties submissions regarding a trial date. Defense counsels conflicts aside, the Court sincerely doubts that a fall trial date would be realistic given the COVID- 19 pandemic. Accordingly, and in light of both defense counsels schedules and the extent of discovery in this case, trial is scheduled to begin on May 24, 2021. The Court will modify that date if the COVID-19 pandemic provides good cause, but the parties should otherwise treat that date as a firm date. It follows that any application that could affect the ability to begin trial on time including but not limited to any discovery-related matter or any issue between a Defendant and his counsel should be brought to the Courts attention in a timely manner- any application made close to the trial date that could affect the ability to begin trial on time may be denied on that basis alone. Defense counsel shall provide a copy of this Order and/or read it to their clients and, no later than June 19, 2020, file letters confirming that they have done so and that Defendants understand that the May 24, 2021 trial date is firm. After reviewing the parties joint letter, the Court will issue an order indicating whether theconference is cancelled and addressing any other relevant deadlines and information. If a conference is held, it will be by telephone or video, albeit perhaps at a different time. To that end, if counsel believe that a conference would be appropriate, they should indicate in their joint letter dates and times during the weeks of both May 18th and May 25th they would be available for a telephone or video conference. In either case, counsel should review and comply with the Courts Emergency Individual Rules and Practices in Light of COVID-19, available at https://nysd.uscourts.gov/hon-jesse-m-furman.

Mr. George has failed to establish that there are extraordinary and compelling reasons to grant him compassionate release. While he appears to be dealing with asthma, that has not been found to be among the top ten risk factors in New York. (See D. Hakim, Asthma is Absent Among Top Covid-19 Risk Factors, Early Data Shows, NY Times, 4/20/20.). Moreover, the record appears to show that his asthma is being treated and that Mr. George is otherwise not in any other risk category (age, heart disease, etc.). In addition, Mr. George was convicted of serious crimes and engaged in substantial efforts to evade apprehension by law enforcement. Thus, he is a serious risk to the public safety. Finally, Mr. George has served a small percentage of his sentence. So, in considering all the factors set forth in Section 3582 and 3553(a), the Court denies the application.

Hantman from Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald, dated 5/11/2020 re: Judge Buchwald writes regarding the withdrawal of petition. ENDORSEMENT: This afternoon, after Mr. McFarland's petition for compassionate release was ripe for review and after chambers inquired last Thursday as to whether the Court should expect any further submissions and was informed that no further filing by counsel would be made, a filing was made stating that the petition was withdrawn without prejudice. While the Court recognizes that it has no power to compel a petitioner to proceed with an application, this obvious effort to avoid a negative result cannot go without comment. The Government's response was filed on April 28, 2020 and ample time passed before today for petitioner to reply or withdraw his petition. To wait until today was simply unprofessional. Like my colleagues, the undersigned has recognized the time sensitivity of applications for compassionate release and thus has always been ready to act when the thirty (30) day exhaustion period has expired. This case was no different. Hence, the outreach to counsel last Thursday and the existing full draft of an opinion. There are enough pressures on everyone at this time without having to work on a matter that a party chooses to pull after the matter is ripe for decision and is obviously on the Court's radar.

Thus, sentencing can only proceed on May 29, 2020, if, after consultation with counsel, defendant waives his right to be physically present and consents to appear by videoconference (or by telephone conference if videoconferencing is not reasonably available). The Court has been advised by defense counsel that defendant does not consent to appearing remotely at the sentencing hearing, and that defendant consents to an adjournment of sentencing to a date in July 2020. Accordingly, sentencing is re-scheduled to July 31, 2020, at 9:30 a.m. At this point, there is no guarantee the Court will be able to conduct in-person proceedings by July 31, 2020. If prior to that date it becomes clear that an in-person proceeding is not possible, the Court will advise the parties so that defense counsel can consult with defendant about whether he is willing to proceed by videoconference or teleconference on July 31, 2020, or whether he wishes to adjourn sentencing to a later date. According to the presentence report, there are multiple Sentencing Guidelines issues that will need to be resolved at sentencing. For that reason, defendant's sentencing submission shall be filed by no later than July 8, 2020, and the government's sentencing submission shall be filed by no later than July 15, 2020.

Defendant was arrested in 1998 on a complaint and ultimately charged in a series of superseding indictments with various crimes relating to the al Qaeda bombings of the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. While awaiting trial before this Court, defendant stabbed and gravely injured a guard at a Bureau of Prisons facility. He was charged before a different district judge in a separate indictment with conspiracy to murder and attempted murder of the guard. United States v. Salim, 01-cr-02 (DAB). That case resulted in bis conviction, and he now is serving a sentence of life imprisonment. See United States v. Salim, 690 F.3d 115 (2d Cir. 2012), cert. denied, 568 U.S. 1115 (2013). Defendant never was brought to trial in this case. On April 30, 2019, the United States Attorney filed a nolle prosequi that the Court approved on May 8, 2019. Accordingly, all of the indictments against defendant in this case have been dismissed. Defendant now moves prose for relief from the judgment or order of dismissal.(See Footnote 1 on this Memorandum Opinion). He argues that the Court erred in approving the nolle without his consent, asserting that he has a right to be tried or to have the indictments against him dismissed.(See Footnote 2 on this Memorandum Opinion). He is mistaken....[See this Memorandum Opinion]... Accordingly, defendant's motion (as yet undocketed due to the impact of the pandemic) is denied. That said, the Court acknowledges defendant's claim that Bureau of Prisons records indicate that defendant is awaiting trial in the Southern District of New York and that there is, or the BOP believes there is, a detainer outstanding against him in this case. The Court is not in a position to determine whether any of that is true. Against the possibility that there is an outstanding detainr against defendant, the Court hereby requests the United States Attorney's office to send a copy of the nolle prosequi to the warden of the institution where the defendant is confined, with a copy to the defendant. The Court requests also that the Clerk of the Court mail a copy of this opinion to the defendant. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Lewis A.

The Court is in receipt of Defendant Frank Mercedes's application for pro bono counsel in connection with a habeas petition that he intends to file (the "Application"). (Doc. No. 283.) For the reasons set forth below, the Application is denied without prejudice to renewal....[See this Order]... In 2017, Judge Castel, overseeing Defendant's case at that time, ruled that Defendant met the financial requirements to be eligible for appointed counsel. (Doc. No. 158.) Based on that finding, and the fact that Defendant is currently incarcerated, the Court finds that Defendant has made a satisfactory showing of financial hardship. Nevertheless, at this early stage, the Court does not have before it a sufficient factual basis from which to determine whether Defendant's claims will likely have merit. First, Defendant's Application provides fewer than ten sentences to explain why he requires a lawyer to assist him in filing his habeas petition. Second, although Defendant's counsel on his direct appeal filed a letter motion advising the Court that Defendant would file the Application, that letter also provides insufficient information for the Court to examine the merits of the claims that Defendant intends to bring or to otherwise analyze the Hodge factors. (See Doc. 282.) Third, the Court is unable to identify from the Second Circuit's decision on Defendant's direct appeal any inherent complexities in the case that would justify appointment of counsel at this stage, particularly compared to other civil cases in which parties cannot afford counsel. Accordingly, Defendant's Application is HEREBY DENIED without prejudice to renewal at a later time if additional grounds for an application are presented to the Court. Any renewed application should utilize the same standard-form application used here, to which Defendant should append an affidavit establishing facts supporting the Hodge factors set forth above. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motion pending at document number 282. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Richard J.

"7:17-cr-00089-CS";"USA v. Londonio et al";"05/13/2020";"order";"Order on Motion for Miscellaneous Relief";"1021  ";"Cathy Seibel";"ORDER denying 1006 Motion for compassionate release sentence reduction as to Brian Vaughan (15): Under 18 USC 3582(c)(1)(a), I may, after considering the factors set forth in 18 USC 3553(a), reduce a sentence if extraordinary and compelling reasons justify such action and it is consistent with the relevant policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. Policy Statement 1B1.13 imposes similar requirements, along with the provision that the Defendant not be a danger to the safety of any other person or the community. Application Note 1 to Policy Statement 1B1.13 describes four potential extraordinary and compelling reasons: 1) the defendant has a terminal medical condition or because of such a health condition is substantially diminished in his ability to provide self-care- 2) the defendant is at least 65 years old and has served 75% of his sentence- 3) family circumstances- and 4) an extraordinary and compelling reason other than or in combination with one of the above. Defendant suggests that he meets the fourth category listed above (extraordinary and compelling reason other than or in combination with one listed) because his medical conditions put him at increased risk should he be stricken with COVID-19. Defendant has numerous orthopedic issues arising from a work accident that, while unfortunate, do not appear on the CDC's list of factors that put individuals at risk for severe illness. He also has high blood pressure, which he describes as "uncontrolled." His medical records reveal that he raised issues about poor control of his blood pressure in September and October 2019, but not since, and this condition -- which in any event is not a CDC-listed risk factor -- appears to be reasonably controlled by medication. He also suffers from diabetes, which is a CDC-listed risk factor. His condition appears mild, as it is treated by pills rather than insulin. He is 54 years old and getting regular medical attention at FCI Englewood. I assume that Defendant' diabetes and even hypertension puts him at increased risk for serious illness should he contract the virus. The risk to him is less than extraordinary and compelling, however, because it seems that no inmates, and only one staff member (who has recovered), have contracted COVID-19 at FCI Englewood, although that could of course change. In any event, even assuming an extraordinary and compelling reason, I must still balance it against the factors set forth in 18 USC 3553(a). See USA v. Daugerdas, 2020 WL 2097653 (S.D.N.Y. 5/1/20). Those factors weigh against release. Mr. Vaughn was sentenced to 84 months in prison for years of organized crime activity. He was not a made member of the Mafia because of his heritage, but he was a longtime mobster in every other way. His crimes included ones such as loansharking and extortion that rely on violence and the fear thereof, as well as the classic organized crime activity of sports betting, and he was an active drug dealer, responsible (per his presentence report) for conspiring to distribute 5 kilograms of cocaine, 10.9 grams of oxycodone and 100 kilograms of marijuana. His drug activity followed a prior eight-year sentence for similar conduct. This activity continued beyond the time Defendant was injured at work. In other words, he did not retire from crime as a result of that injury. His sentence of 84 months was appropriate, considering the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the Defendant, and the other 3553(a) factors. It would undermine several of those factors to release Mr. Vaughn now, when he has served less than half of his sentence. Such a substantial reduction would result in a sentence that does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offense or of Mr. Vaughn's record, and thus would have Mr. Vaughn serving a sentence that is not just punishment. It would diminish respect for the law for an offender to get such a large reduction in these circumstances, and it would introduce unwarranted sentencing disparity. See Daugerdas. The Court believes, however, that should the virus spread within FCI Englewood, Mr. Vaughn's health could be safeguarded without undermining the 3553(a) factors by a temporary furlough under 18 USC 3622. Only BOP can order such a furlough, but the Court recommends that if FCI Englewood experiences more cases, BOP should give serious consideration to temporary release for Mr. Vaughn, under proper conditions, after which he would complete his sentence. While Mr. Vaughn's history suggests he could be a danger to the community, and he might well return to criminal activity if released for any length of time, the Court believes that he would not present a danger if released to home for a limited period. (The Court notes that the state to which Mr. Vaughn would be released -- New Jersey -- has experienced a high level of corona virus infections, so temporary release would not make sense absent an increase in the risk at FCI Englewood, and suitable quarantine arrangements would have to be made.) The Government is directed to send a copy of this text order to the Warden and the legal department at FCI Englewood.. (Signed by Judge Cathy Seibel on 05/13/2020) (Seibel, Cathy)"

Before the Court is a renewed request by Defendant Tyreek Ogarro for compassionate release under the First Step Act of 2018, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. (Doc. No. 680.) Ogarro previously sought such relief in early April (Doc. No. 644), which the government opposed on both procedural and substantive grounds (Doc. No. 650). The Court denied Ogarro's request, finding that he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. (Doc. No. 666.) Since then, Ogarro has satisfied that procedural hurdle and the Court may now consider his motion on the merits. Although Ogarro has shown great progress during his incarceration, the reasons supporting his original sentence -- imposed just three months ago -- weigh strongly against a compassionate release at this time. Accordingly, Ogarro's motion is DENIED....[See this Order]... Of course, as the Court mentioned in its previous order, this does not mean that Ogarro is out of options. (Doc. No. 666 at 10.) Given Ogarro's admirable track record while incarcerated, he appears to be an excellent candidate for temporary release under 18 U.S.C. § 3622. The Court therefore recommends that the Bureau of Prisons consider granting Ogarro a furlough during the pendency of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. That decision, however, is exclusively reserved to the discretion of the Bureau of Prisons. For the reasons set forth above, Ogarro's motion for compassionate release is DENIED. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motion pending at document number 680, and the government is directed to serve a copy of this order on the warden of Ogarro's facility and to the Regional Counsel of the Bureau of Prisons.

Under 18 USC 3582(c)(1)(a), I may, after considering the factors set forth in 18 USC 3553(a), reduce a sentence if extraordinary and compelling reasons justify such action and it is consistent with the relevant policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. Policy Statement 1B1.13 imposes similar requirements, along with the provision that the Defendant not be a danger to the safety of any other person or the community. Application Note 1 to Policy Statement 1B1.13 describes four potential extraordinary and compelling reasons: 1) the defendant has a terminal medical condition or because of such a health condition is substantially diminished in his ability to provide self-care- 2) the defendant is at least 65 years old and has served 75% of his sentence- 3) family circumstances- and 4) an extraordinary and compelling reason other than or in combination with one of the above. Defendant suggests that he meets the fourth category listed above (extraordinary and compelling reason other than or in combination with one listed) because he is 62 years old and has a medical condition that puts him at increased risk should he be stricken with COVID-19 -- specifically, a heart condition that required surgery last year. A serious heart condition is, according to the CDC, a risk factor. But Defendant's medical records suggest that the surgery was successful and his condition has resolved. He appears to be receiving appropriate medical attention at FCI Fort Dix. I recognize that the conditions there do not allow for the social distancing and other measures necessary to safeguard against contracting COVID-19, but Defendant has not shown that his health is sufficiently compromised to raise that risk to the level of extraordinary and compelling. Assuming for the sake of argument that he has shown extraordinary and compelling circumstances within the meaning of 18 USC 3582(c)(1)(A), I still must balance those circumstances against the factors set forth in 18 USC 3553(a). See USA v. Daugerdas, 2020 WL 2097653 (S.D.N.Y. 5/1/20). Those factors weigh heavily against release. Defendant committed an extraordinarily heinous crime, one of the most disturbing this Court has encountered. His Guidelines range was 240 months' imprisonment, and the Court sentenced him significantly below that, in large part in light of what appeared to be sincere insight and remorse. The instant application suggests that the Court's belief in Defendant's sincere insight and remorse was misplaced. His application contains a shocking minimization of the horror his conduct inflicted on two innocent children. It shows a massive lack of insight for him to say that his offense -- directing a disturbed woman to sexually molest two children while he watched on video and masturbated -- was a non-contact, computer-related offense that did not involve coercion or violence. Defendant's failure to appreciate the seriousness of his conduct and the harm that he caused to real children in real time suggests he would present a danger to the community if released. The original sentence was appropriate, even merciful, considering the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the Defendant, and the other 3553(a) factors. It would undermine several of those factors to release Defendant now, when he has served less than 60% of his sentence. Such a substantial reduction would not sufficiently account for the nature and circumstances of the offense and would not be just punishment. It would diminish respect for the law for an offender to get such a large reduction in these circumstances, it would introduce unwarranted sentencing disparity, and it would inadequately protect the public against further crimes. See generally Daugerdas. Finally, Defendant has presented no plan that would begin to safeguard the community. A letter from 2018 from his now ex-wife, written as part of their divorce negotiations over their house, in which she says she will ensure he has somewhere to live if he is released early, hardly suggests that Defendant has a release plan,, let alone one that would permit the close supervision under which Defendant must be for the rest of his life. For all these reasons, the application is denied. The Government is directed to send a copy of this text order to Defendant.(Signed by Judge Cathy Seibel on 05/13/2020) (Seibel, Cathy)"

The sentencing in this case is currently scheduled for June 12, 2020, at 2:30 p.m. Defense counsel has advised the Court that his client wishes to go forward with sentencing as scheduled. However, because of the current COVID-19 public health crisis, it will not be possible to conduct the sentencing in person on June 12, 2020. Rule 43(a)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the defendant's physical presence at sentencing. During the current national emergency, however, Section 15002(b)(2)(A) and (b)(4) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ("CARES") Act, empowers the Court to conduct a sentencing by video-conference (or telephone conference if videoconferencing is not reasonably available) if (i) the defendant consents after consultation with counsel, and (ii) the Court finds "for specific reasons" that the "sentencing... cannot be further delayed without serious harm to the interests of justice." Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that by May 27, 2020, either party (or both parties jointly) shall explain to the Court in writing the specific reasons why sentencing cannot be further delayed without serious harm to interests of justice. By that date, defense counsel shall also advise the Court in writing whether his client waives his right to be physically present and consents to appear by video conference (or by telephone conference if video-conferencing is not reasonably available). In the event sentencing goes forward on June 12, 2020, the exact time for the sentencing hearing will have to be re-set to either 9:00 a.m. or 11:00 a.m., to comply with strict scheduling protocols at MCC, where defendant is currently housed.

He admits that that condition has cleared up, but maintains he has some sort of chronic condition for which he is on several medications. I cannot tell what condition that is, so the Government shall provide Mr. DeRuggiero's full medical record for his most recent stint in BOP, as soon as possible. The Government shall also advise as to whether a prisoner can self-quarantine at Fort Dix before release- in other words, if I were to let Mr. DeRuggiero go, but he could not self-quarantine for 14 days on the street because he does not have a plan for where to live, could he self-quarantine within the prison? Further, I strongly urge BOP to consider home confinement for Mr. DeRuggiero's remaining month of incarceration, provided sufficient arrangements for self-quarantine can be made. He has only about a month more- he is going to be on the street without supervision then in any event- and reducing the population at Fort Dix would seem to be a good idea.

(If he is asking to serve the remainder of his sentence in home confinement under 18 USC 3522, only the Bureau of Prisons can grant that relief.) Under 18 USC 3582(c)(1)(a), I may, after considering the factors set forth in 18 USC 3553(a), reduce a sentence if extraordinary and compelling reasons justify such action and it is consistent with the relevant policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. Policy Statement 1B1.13 imposes similar requirements, along with the provision that the Defendant not be a danger to the safety of any other person or the community. Application Note 1 to Policy Statement 1B1.13 describes four potential extraordinary and compelling reasons: 1) the defendant has a terminal medical condition or because of such a health condition is substantially diminished in his ability to provide self-care- 2) the defendant is at least 65 years old and has served 75% of his sentence- 3) family circumstances- and 4) an extraordinary and compelling reason other than or in combination with one of the above. Defendant has not articulated, let alone demonstrated, an extraordinary and compelling reason why he should be released. He discusses generally the difficulty of social distancing within the Metropolitan Correctional Center. I do not doubt that any prisoner there is at increased risk of contracting the virus, compared to an unincarcerated person whose living quarters are sufficiently roomy and who follows the advice of public health professionals (which, given his track record of not following the rules, I doubt Defendant would do). But luckily Defendant is young and healthy and has no medical conditions putting him at elevated risk for a severe case. And, fortunately, at this moment only 19 staff and no prisoners at MCC are known to be positive for COVID-19. If the mere existence of the virus in the suboptimal conditions of a prison were sufficient to find extraordinary and compelling circumstances, all prisoners would be eligible for release. I cannot in good faith find an extraordinary and compelling reason for release in Defendant's case, and accordingly deny the motion without reaching the 3553(a) factors or danger to the community. The Government shall send a copy of this text order to Defendant (or advise my chambers if unable to do so).. (Signed by Judge Cathy Seibel on 05/13/2020) (Seibel, Cathy)"

On November 26, 2002, the Court sentenced defendant Julius Williams ("Williams") to a total term of imprisonment of 600 months, followed by six years' supervised release. (See Dkt. No. 381.) Williams is serving his sentence at FCC Allenwood. By letter dated April 20, 2020, Williams requested immediate compassionate release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 3582(c)(1)(A) ("Section 3582"). (See Attached Letter.) Williams contends that he is at high risk of contracting COVID-19 and, if he does, suffering serious illness and death. Williams notes that he has high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol and suffers from a damaged nerve in his right eye. Williams asks that he be placed on home confinement to reduce his risk of contracting COVID-19. Williams does not specify whether he has submitted any written request to the warden of FCC Allenwood....[See this Order]... The Court is entirely sympathetic to the plight of Williams and other inmates in his position. The Court encourages Williams to submit a request to the warden of FCC Allenwood. If the warden denies his request, he must appeal to the appropriate BOP Regional Director and, if that appeal fails, to the BOP General Counsel before renewing his Motion. See 28 C.F.R. §§ 571.63(a), 542.15(a). Alternatively, if the BOP takes no action within 30 days after receiving Williams's request, he may renew his Motion before this Court. See Section 3582. Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that the defendant's Motion is DENIED. Defendant may renew his request upon compliance with the terms of the statute.

He had an upper respiratory infection in March that by his own account has cleared up. He has not demonstrated an extraordinary and compelling reason why he should be released. I recognize the difficulty of social distancing within a prison, and do not doubt that any prisoner is at increased risk of contracting the virus, compared to an unincarcerated person whose living quarters are sufficiently roomy and who follows the advice of public health professionals (which, given his track record of not following the rules, I doubt Defendant would do). But the mere existence of the virus in the institution is not itself enough for me to find extraordinary and compelling circumstances. So I cannot find that Mr. DeRuggiero has met the conditions for a sentence reduction under 18 USC 3582(c)(1)(A). But it seems, frankly, crazy to me that the Bureau of Prisons has not used its authority under 18 USC 3622 or 18 USC 3624(c) to get Mr. DeRuggiero out (following an appropriate period of quarantine), given how close he is to the end of his sentence and how it can only benefit all inmates and staff to reduce the population of the facility. In order to ensure that someone in authority takes notice of this situation, I am directing that a responsible official at BOP, within one week, provide the Court with a written explanation of its reasoning regarding Mr. DeRuggiero. If it is arbitrary and capricious, it might support an application under 28 USC 2241 to the appropriate court in New Jersey.

Instead, the Court expects to conduct the sentencing by videoconference (or telephone conference if videoconferencing is not reasonably available). After consulting with defendant, defense counsel has advised the Court that defendant is willing to waive his right to be physically present at sentencing and consents to proceed by videoconference. Although Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(a)(3) ordinarily requires the defendant's physical presence at sentencing, during the current national emergency, the Court is authorized pursuant to Section 15002(b)(2)(A) of the CARES Act to conduct a sentencing by videoconference (or telephone conference if videoconferencing is not reasonably available) if the Court finds "for specific reasons" that the "sentencing... cannot be further delayed without serious harm to the interests of justice."

Although the Court does not supply these documents to inmates out of concern for their safety, Mr. Thomas case manager should have a copy of his presentence investigation report and can review it with Mr. Thomas.

On May 14, 2020, the Court received a letter from Mr. Childs requesting that the Court order his compassionate release to home confinement pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c). Dkt. No. 704. Mr. Child's letter cites the fact that COVID-19 spreads like wildfire over these last months,"and cites the challenges facing his institution, and the prison system as a whole, in remedying its effects. Mr. Childs letter acknowledges that his primary concern isn't merely my own safety, but also his mothers safety given a number of health challenges that she is confronting. Mr. Childs' motion does not present extraordinary and compelling reasons for Mr. Childs'release. Mr. Childs does not have any particular health concerns that raise the risk associated with COVID-19. As a young man, he is not in a high risk age bracket. While the Court appreciates that Mr. Childs' mother would benefit from his presence, the fact that Mr. Childs' incarceration makes him unavailable to participate in the lives of his family members is not an extraordinary result of his sentence, and does not present a compelling reason for his release. Because Mr. Childs application does not meet this threshold requirement, the application is denied The Court certifies, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(3), that any appeal from this order would not be taken in good faith, and therefore IFP status is denied for the purpose of an appeal.

The Government's opposition is due no later than June 19, 2020- defendant's reply, if any, is due no later than June 25, 2020. The hearing date remains scheduled for July 10, 2020. The Court reminds the parties that they have not requested, and the Court has not granted, an extension of the deadline for the submission of other pretrial materials. See Dkt. Nos. 27, 32. Further extensions of the deadlines will not preserve the possibility of proceeding on the scheduled trial date. In light of the recent extradition of Mr. Kromah's co-defendant, the constraints imposed by COVID-19, and the prospect of the introduction of new counsel to represent Mr. Kromah, the Court encourages counsel for the United States and for both defendants to confer regarding the currently scheduled trial date and to make any applications to the Court with respect to it and the associated deadlines that they believe to be appropriate.

As relevant here, on July 7, 2011, a jury convicted defendant George Salemo of two counts of wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343, and, on October 19, 2011, the Court sentenced him to 162 months' imprisonment. See ECF Nos. 6, 49. Salemo has since been incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution, Fairton (FCI Fairton), and his projected releasedate is May 22, 2022. For these reasons, the Court finds that no extraordinaryand compelling reason exists for granting Salemos motion for compassionate release, and therefore denies the motion. Nonetheless, given all the circumstances, the Court, sua sponte, recommends to the BOP that it consider Salemo for release to home confinement under the broader discretion available to the BOP.

Instead, he argues that exhaustion should not be required under the current circumstances. See id. at 2-3.

This Ruling implements the resentencing of Defendant Jaime Rodriguez. The occasion for resentencing is derived from the Court's opinion, reported at 2020 WL 1878112 (S.D.N.Y. April 15, 2020) (the "April 15 Opinion"), which vacated Rodriguez's conviction and sentence under the firearms statute, 18 U.S.C. §924(c). The facts and circumstances of the case are fully set forth in that opinion, familiarity with which is assumed, and are reiterated herein only to the extent necessary to explicate the revised sentence the Court now imposes....[See this Ruling On Resentencing]... IV. For the foregoing reasons, I hold that the application to Rodriguez's case of the § 3553 factors and sentencing purposes, together and in combination, results in the conclusion that a sentence of Time Served is the just sentence to impose upon Rodriguez on the occasion of this resentencing. That conclusion does no violence to the Court's 2009 resentence, to the extent that the 2009 resentence should be read as requiring that Rodriguez serve some time in addition to the sentence imposed by Judge Keenan in the unrelated case. Rodriguez is presently, and has been, serving time beyond time imposed by Judge Keenan. Indeed, Rodriguez is currently serving time on his conviction under Count Five of the indictment, the § 924(c) firearms charge and sentence, which this Court vacated in the April 15 Opinion. That reasoning of that Opinion also requires vacatur of Count One of the indictment. In consequence, the Court makes this Order: 1. The sentence imposed upon Defendant Jaime Rodriguez as the result of his resentencing on this indictment by this Court in 2009 is VACATED in its entirety. 2. On Counts Two, Three and Four of the indictment, Defendant Jaime Rodriguez is resentenced to TIME SERVED. 3.

Boria";"05/18/2020";"order";"Order on Letter Motion";"388  ";"Cathy Seibel";"ORDER denying 384 LETTER MOTION for compassionate release sentence reduction as to Collyer Goodman (10): Under 18 USC 3582(c)(1)(a), I may, after considering the factors set forth in 18 USC 3553(a), reduce a sentence if extraordinary and compelling reasons justify such action and it is consistent with the relevant policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. Policy Statement 1B1.13 imposes similar requirements, along with the provision that the Defendant not be a danger to the safety of any other person or the community. Application Note 1 to Policy Statement 1B1.13 describes four potential extraordinary and compelling reasons: 1) the defendant has a terminal medical condition or because of a serious health condition or impairment is substantially diminished in his ability to provide self-care- 2) the defendant is at least 65 years old, has served 10 years or 75% of his sentence, and is experiencing serious deterioration in health as a result of aging- 3) family circumstances- and 4) an extraordinary and compelling reason other than or in combination with one of the above. Defendant suggests that he meets the fourth category listed above (extraordinary and compelling reason other than or in combination with one listed) because he has suffers from asthma and is a sarcoma survivor whose scars still give him problems, and therefore is at increased risk should he be stricken with COVID-19. (The Government incorrectly suggests that only category 1 is at issue, but a combination of factors can still be extraordinary and compelling even if the inmate can provide self-care.) According to the Centers for Disease Control ("CDC"), being a cancer survivor is not a risk factor. It is a risk factor if one is immunocompromised as a result of cancer treatment, but Defendant does not show or even claim that he is undergoing cancer treatment or that he is immunocompromised. The CDC lists moderate to severe asthma as a risk factor. Defendant has not shown that his asthma meets that threshold. His medical records characterize his asthma as mild and intermittent. He alleges that in recent weeks his condition has worsened, he has been coughing, and he had an asthma attack on March 30. (He also claims to have lost his sense of taste and smell, a symptom of COVID-19.) The Court views these recent claims with some skepticism, as they allegedly arose after the corona virus pandemic began and his medical records show that his lungs were fine when examined on April 6 and April 12. Certain submissions by Defendant during the case, (Docs. 253, 260-1) were at least approaching the disingenuous, and Doc. 387 Ex. E-2, authored much more recently is of the same ilk. But I will assume for the sake of argument that Defendant's medical condition -- combined with the impossibility of social distancing in prison, the COVID-19 outbreak at FCI Elkton, the apparent inability of the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") to mitigate that outbreak, and what may be defiance of orders of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois -- amount to an extraordinary and compelling reason for release. I must still must balance it against the factors set forth in 18 USC 3553(a). See USA v. Daugerdas, 2020 WL 2097653 (S.D.N.Y. 5/1/20). Those factors weigh against release. Defendant was sentenced to a mandatory minimum of ten years' imprisonment for dealing a significant amount of narcotics. He had numerous prior convictions, many involving drugs and/or weapons, and he returned to criminal activity relatively quickly after those convictions. While there were significant mitigating factors in Defendant's traumatic childhood and business and family success, his offense was and remains puzzling, given that he experienced neither addiction nor financial need. It would undermine several of the 3553(a) factors to release Defendant now, when he has served only about 40% of his sentence. Such a substantial reduction would not give sufficient weight to the seriousness of the offense or Defendant's criminal history- it would undermine respect for the law- it would not amount to just punishment- it would undermine whatever deterrent value the sentence may have- it would introduce unwarranted sentencing disparities- and it would not sufficiently address the need to protect the public from further crimes of Defendant. Defendant has a record of repeated and regular serious violations of law, and his recent prison discipline -- based on a confrontation with a correction officer over a contraband cellphone -- gives little reason for confidence that that pattern would be different this time around. The Court believes, however, that Defendant's health could be safeguarded without undermining the 3553(a) factors by a temporary furlough under 18 USC 3622. The Court recommends that BOP give serious consideration to temporary release for Defendant, under proper conditions, after which he would complete his sentence. While Defendant's track record suggests he could be a danger to the community if his sentence were reduced to time served, the Court believes that that risk is mitigated if the release were brief and temporary. A short furlough -- either until conditions at FCI Elkton are under better control or for a shorter period during which Defendant could surrender himself to a different facility with lower risk -- rather than a sentence reduction, strikes the Court as the most fair and sensible balance of both the public interest and the risk to Defendant. And reducing the population at FCI Elkton can only help in the efforts to safeguard staff and prisoners there. The Government is directed to send a copy of this text order to the Warden and the legal department at FCI Elkton. (Signed by Judge Cathy Seibel on 05/05/2020) (Seibel, Cathy) (Entered: 05/05/2020).

On January 7, 2020, the Court commenced a sentencing hearing in this matter. During the proceeding, defense counsel objected to the government's proposed forfeiture order in the amount of $1,610,140.75. (Jan. 7, 2020 Tr. at 28:5-11, ECF No. 252.) Defense counsel argued that because the government allegedly provided no evidence as to how it reached this figure, it failed to meet its burden by a preponderance of the evidence. (Id.) The Court directed the government to refile the proposed forfeiture order with citations to the record. (Id. at 30:10-12.) The government complied. (ECF No. 246.) Soon after, the defendant filed an opposition contending that there is no evidence the funds had a nexus to criminal activity and requesting that the Court conduct a hearing to determine the proper forfeiture amount. (ECF No. 254 at 3, 5.) The Court construed defendant's letter as a request for a hearing pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.2(b)(1)(B). (ECF No. 256.) The rule provides, in relevant part, "[i]f the forfeiture is contested, on either party's request the court must conduct a hearing after the verdict or finding of guilty." Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(b)(1)(B). The Court set the hearing date for March 19, 2020 and ordered the parties to inform the Court in writing "as to what witnesses, if any, they intend to call and what exhibits, if any, they intend to introduce on or before February 28, 2020." (ECF No. 256.) On February 28, 2020, the government submitted a letter stating that it did not intend to call any witnesses or introduce any new exhibits at the scheduled hearing. (ECF No. 257 at 1.)...[See this Order]... Id. Defense counsel did not file anything by the February 28 deadline and has not done so to date. On March 13, 2020, in light of the uncertainty concerning the COVID-19 outbreak, the Court adjourned the forfeiture hearing scheduled for March 19 to March 24, 2020. (ECF No. 261.) In that scheduling order, the Court noted that "the defendant has not informed the Court regarding what witnesses, if any, he intends to call and what exhibits, if any, he intends to introduce." (Id.) As circumstances with the virus worsened, the hearing was rescheduled again to May 28, 2020 at 11:00 A.M. (ECF No. 262.) The Court concludes from defendant's failure to respond to the Court's order dated February 12 (ECF No. 256) and order dated March 13 (ECF No. 261), directing defendant to set forth the witnesses and exhibits he intends to introduce at the hearing, that there are no such witnesses and exhibits outside of the papers already submitted on this issue. Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that a fact hearing is unnecessary and the forfeiture issue will be decided on the record already submitted. SO ORDERED: (Signed by Judge Sidney H.

I find that the ends of justice will be served by granting a continuance and that taking such action outweighs the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.

Braverman dated May 4, 2020 re: Reply to Government Letter in Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Bail Document filed by Christopher Martinez. ENDORSEMENT: Bail Application is denied. There has been no change regarding the flight risk and community danger that Mr. Martinez presents, as found by Judge Davison. Instead, Mr. Martinez relies on the interplay between the COVID pandemic and his health issues. However, the records suggest that Mr. Martinez has pre-diabetes, and not diabetes. While pre-diabetes is potentially serious, it is controllable by things like exercise and diet. He claims limited ability to change his diet, but his claims are unpersuasive (e.g., he does not want to ask his family for money for brown rice), and he makes no claims about exercise. His claim regarding hypertension seems exaggerated, given what the records say about his actual blood pressure readings, which are taken regularly. And, his claim about asthma also is lacking support in the medical records and, in any event, asthma has not been identified in the top 10 as a comorbitity factor in NY. Moreover, Mr. Martinez is 29 years old, far from the age range that magnifies the risk from his health issues. And, finally, notwithstanding counsel's sarcastic commentary about WCJ's efforts, the evidence demonstrates that the pandemic is, relatively speaking, under control at WCJ. Therefore, the application is denied without prejudice. (Signed by Judge Kenneth M. Karas on 5/18/2020) (ap)"

On April 29, 2020, counsel for the defendant requested an extension of the deadline for the pre-sentence report to May 15, 2020. Dkt. No. 40. The application did not disclose that the defendant had not met the 14 day deadline for the submission of objections to the draft presentence report. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(f). As a result, the Court understood that the defendants objections had been timely submitted and that the additional time requested was to permit the parties to work through objections interposed by the defendant. The Court granted the requested extension for the final report on April 29, 2020. Dkt. No. 41. The Court has been informed that the defendant did not submit her objections to the draft report until May 15, 2020, nearly six weeks after the delivery of the draft report.

"7:16-cr-00727-CS";"USA v. Jackson";"05/18/2020";"order";"Order on Motion to Reduce Sentence";"35  ";"Cathy Seibel";"ORDER denying 31 Motion to Reduce Sentence as to Travis Jackson (1): Under 18 USC 3582(c)(1)(a), I may, after considering the factors set forth in 18 USC 3553(a), reduce a sentence if extraordinary and compelling reasons justify such action and it is consistent with the relevant policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. Policy Statement 1B1.13 imposes similar requirements, along with the provision that the Defendant not be a danger to the safety of any other person or the community. Application Note 1 to Policy Statement 1B1.13 describes four potential extraordinary and compelling reasons: 1) the defendant has a terminal medical condition or because of a serious health condition or impairment is substantially diminished in his ability to provide self-care- 2) the defendant is at least 65 years old, has served 10 years or 75% of his sentence, and is experiencing serious deterioration in health as a result of aging- 3) family circumstances- and 4) an extraordinary and compelling reason other than or in combination with one of the above. Defendant suggests that he meets the fourth category listed above (extraordinary and compelling reason other than or in combination with one listed) because he suffers from medical conditions that put him at increased risk should he be stricken with COVID-19. Specifically, he alleges that he is 67 years old and has high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia (high cholesterol), mild pulmonary atelectasis or edema, cardiovascular disease and a body mass index ("BMI") of 32.8, and needs a double knee replacement. High blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, a BMI of 32.8 and bad knees are not, according to the Centers for Disease Control ("CDC"), risk factors for severe illness. While a serious heart condition is a risk factor, Defendant's medical records contain no indication of such a condition or of cardiovascular disease. Chronic lung disease is also a risk factor, but Defendant's medical records show only that on one occasion in January 2020, he had appeared to have mild pulmonary edema or mild atelectasis. A chest x-ray on February 5, 2020 was normal. I cannot conclude that Defendant has chronic lung disease. So it appears that his only real risk factor is his age. But I will assume for the sake of argument that Defendant's medical condition, combined with the impossibility of social distancing in prison, amount to an extraordinary and compelling reason for release. I must still must balance it against the factors set forth in 18 USC 3553(a). See USA v. Daugerdas, 2020 WL 2097653 (S.D.N.Y. 5/1/20). Those factors weigh against release. Defendant was sentenced to 78 months' imprisonment for two robberies (one of a convenience store and one of a bank) in which he threatened the victims with what appeared to be a gun. While detained he attempted to obstruct justice by having his codefendant sign a false affidavit. He had numerous prior convictions, including several for robbery and for which he served substantial sentences, yet he was undeterred from continuing that same activity. After a 5-15 year sentence, he reoffended (and violated his parole)- after a 3-6 year sentence he reoffended (and violated his parole)- and after serving 21 years and then successfully completing parole, he committed the instant offenses about six months later. There were mitigating factors in traumatic experiences from Defendant's childhood and military service, but he was getting good mental health treatment from the Veterans Admiinistration, yet stopped taking the recommended medication that was helping him and returned to abusing alcohol. Defendant has served approximately 60% of his total sentence and approximately 70% of his required prison time, assuming he continues to accrue good time. It would undermine several of the 3553(a) factors to release Defendant now. Such a substantial reduction would not give sufficient weight to the seriousness of the offense, its effect on the victims, or Defendant's criminal history- it would undermine respect for the law- it would not amount to just punishment- it would introduce unwarranted sentencing disparities- and it would not sufficiently address the need to protect the public from further crimes of Defendant. Of perhaps most concern is protecting the public. Defendant has a record of repeated and regular serious violations of law through violent crimes that undoubtedly terrorize the victims. Given his repeated resort to robberies throughout his life, well past middle age and despite significant sentences, the risk of further crimes he presents is, on balance, just too great, particularly as robberies with a weapon or what appears to be a weapon do not necessarily require a great deal of physical agility. But the Court recommends that BOP give consideration to temporary release under 18 USC 3622 for Defendant, under proper conditions, after which he would complete his sentence. While Defendant's track record suggests he might be a danger to the community if his sentence were reduced to time served, the Court believes that that risk could be mitigated if the release were brief and temporary. A short furlough -- either until the corona virus epidemic is under better control or, better yet, for a shorter period during which Defendant could surrender himself to a different facility with lower risk (if he had the means to do so) -- rather than a sentence reduction, strikes the Court as the most fair and sensible balance of both the public interest and the risk to Defendant. And reducing the population at FCI Fort Dix can only help in the efforts to safeguard staff and prisoners there. The Government is directed to send a copy of this text order to the Warden and the legal department at FCI Fort Dix.. (Signed by Judge Cathy Seibel on 05/18/2020) (Seibel, Cathy)"

"7:17-cr-00089-CS";"USA v. Londonio et al";"05/18/2020";"order";"Order on Motion to Reduce Sentence";"1026  ";"Cathy Seibel";"ORDER denying 1012 Motion to Reduce Sentence as to Joseph Dinapoli (5): Defendant has moved for a sentence reduction. Defendant has appealed his sentence, vesting jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals, but I have jurisdiction to deny the application or give an indicative ruling. Under 18 USC 3582(c)(1)(a), I may, after considering the factors set forth in 18 USC 3553(a), reduce a sentence if extraordinary and compelling reasons justify such action and it is consistent with the relevant policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. Policy Statement 1B1.13 imposes similar requirements, along with the provision that the Defendant not be a danger to the safety of any other person or the community. Application Note 1 to Policy Statement 1B1.13 describes four potential extraordinary and compelling reasons: 1) the defendant has a terminal medical condition or because of a serious health condition or impairment is substantially diminished in his ability to provide self-care- 2) the defendant is at least 65 years old, has served 10 years or 75% of his sentence, and is experiencing serious deterioration in health as a result of aging- 3) family circumstances- and 4) an extraordinary and compelling reason other than or in combination with one of the above. Defendant suggests that he meets the fourth category listed above (extraordinary and compelling reason other than or in combination with one listed) because he is 84 years old and has medical conditions that put him at increased risk should he be stricken with COVID-19. The medical information in the record shows that he indeed presents with several of the factors identified by the Centers for Disease Control as increasing the risk of severe disease: age, serious heart condition, diabetes and chronic lung disease. (Oddly, the conditions listed in counsel's application do not match those in Defendant's doctor's letter, and the signature on that letter does not look authentic when compared to other signatures from that doctor that I have seen in this case and others. Perhaps someone in his office signed for him. In any event, the discrepancies do not affect my evaluation of Defendant's risk factors.) Defendant's medical condition, combined with the impossibility of social distancing at the Metropolitan Correctional Center ("MCC"), amount to an extraordinary and compelling reason for release. But I must still must balance it against the factors set forth in 18 USC 3553(a). See USA v. Daugerdas, 2020 WL 2097653 (S.D.N.Y. 5/1/20). Those factors weigh heavily against release. Defendant's sentencing range was 70-87 months, and he was sentenced to 52 months largely because of his health. He is a lifelong mobster who rose to the position of consigliere, a leadership role, in a murderous organization. He capitalized on and enriched himself through the violence and fear inflicted by that organization, and his position allows him to direct the activities of others. Prior significant sentences have done nothing to deter him. The instant case is his tenth conviction and his fifth federal conviction. It would grossly undermine several of the 3553(a) factors to release Defendant now, when he has served less than three months of his sentence. Such a substantial reduction would not give sufficient weight to either the seriousness of the offense or Defendant's eye-popping criminal history- it would undermine respect for the law- it would not amount to just punishment- it would introduce unwarranted sentencing disparities- and it would not sufficiently address the need to protect the public from further crimes of Defendant. Defendant has a record of repeated and regular serious violations of law, and given this track record, there is little reason for confidence that he would now eschew his sworn loyalty to the Lucchese Family of La Cosa Nostra if the remainder of his prison term were eliminated. That he complied with his conditions of release before surrendering does not erase the concern that, as a lifelong mobster, he will, if his sentence is reduced, do what he has always done and revert to criminal activity. He thus presents a danger to the community. The Court believes, however, that Defendant's health could be safeguarded without undermining the 3553(a) factors or the safety of the community by a brief temporary furlough under 18 USC 3622. The Court strongly recommends that the Bureau of Prisons give serious consideration to temporary release for Defendant, under proper conditions, after which he would complete his sentence. While Defendant's record suggests a risk of danger to the community if his sentence were reduced to time served, the Court believes that that risk would be mitigated if the release were brief and temporary. A short furlough -- either until the corona virus is under better control or, better yet, for a shorter period during which Defendant could surrender himself to his designated facility at FMC Butner -- rather than a sentence reduction, strikes the Court as the most fair and sensible balance of both the public interest and the risk to Defendant. And reducing the population at MCC New York can only help in the efforts to safeguard staff and prisoners there. The Government is directed to send a copy of this text order to the Warden and the legal department at MCC New York. Finally, I reject the contention that the medical care Defendant is getting amounts to an eighth amendment violation or otherwise implicates 28 USC 2241. While Defendant may not be getting the same type of care or the same prescriptions that he got on the outside, he is getting regular medical attention, and at his last medical visit on 5/11/20, he said he "feels fine" except for needing to urinate during the night. The record contains no basis on which I could conclude that the care he is receiving is so inadequate as to amount to a constitutional violation.

By a petition dated April 22, 2020, and filed on the electronic docket on May 7, 2020, Defendant Damian Cunningham has moved for release from custody under the First Step Act of 2018, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A). (Doc. No. 646.) The government opposes Cunningham's motion. (Doc. No. 648.) Because it appears that Cunningham has not yet exhausted his administrative remedies, his request is DENIED without prejudice....[See this Order]... Based on the submissions provided to the Court, it appears that Cunningham has not exhausted his administrative remedies. In his petition, Cunningham broadly asserts that "[t]heFirst Step Act... now allows all federal courts to directly reduce sentence under [section 3582(c)(1)(A)] without awaiting a motion from the Bureau of Prisons-" he also vaguely states that he "made an approach to the Bureau of Prisons as advised by the Office of the Warden at the institutional level and was denied." (Doc. No. 646 at 2.) As support, he cites to an unnamed attachment. (Id.) But the only document attached to the petition is an October 2019 Reentry Plan from the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). (See id. at 1617.) That document makes no mention of a request to the BOP for early release under section 3582(c)(1)(A). Further, the government represents in its letter that it "has been informed by the BOP that it has no record of the defendant submitting a request to the BOP for a reduction in sentence pursuant to [s]ection 3582(c)(1)(A)" or for home confinement under 18 U.S.C. § 3624(c)(2). (Doc. No. 648 at 2.) Accordingly, since Cunningham has failed to demonstrate that he has met the statutory exhaustion requirements for section 3582(c)(1)(A), his request for compassionate release is DENIED without prejudice.

Before the Court is a renewed request by Defendant Tony Garcia for compassionate release under the First Step Act of 2018, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. (Doc. No. 275.) Garcia previously sought such relief in early April (Doc. No. 272), which the government opposed on procedural grounds (Doc. No. 270). The Court denied Garcia's request, finding that he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. (Doc. No. 273.) Since then, Garcia has satisfied that procedural hurdle, and the Court may now consider his motion on the merits. Although Garcia has a medical condition that puts him at a higher risk of serious health consequences should he contract COVID-19, the reasons supporting his sentence -- imposed less than three months ago -- weigh strongly against a compassionate release at this time. Accordingly, Garcia's motion is DENIED....[See this Order]... Of course, as the Court noted in its previous order (Doc. No. 273), Garcia may still pursue relief in the form of a furlough under 18 U.S.C. § 3622 or home confinement as contemplated in the CARES Act, Pub. L. No. 116-136 (2020), and the Attorney General's April 3, 2020 memorandum to the BOP. The decision to grant that relief, however, is exclusively reserved to the discretion of the BOP. For the reasons set forth above, Garcia's motion for compassionate release is DENIED. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motion pending at document number 275. SO ORDERED.

On May 18, 2020, the Court received an undated letter from Defendant Tyreek Ogarro request ing a release from incarceration in light of the COVID-19 pandemic (attached hereto). Though not styled as such, Mr. Ogarro's request appears to renew or supplement his previously filed motion for compassionate release under the First Step Act of 2018, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A). While the Court recently denied that motion by order dated May 13, 2020 (Doc. No. 683), it is likely that this letter was mailed before that date. Having considered Mr. Ogarro's letter, nothing set forth therein alters the Court's conclusion that "the reasons supporting [Mr. Ogarro's] original sentence -- imposed just three months ago -- weigh strongly against a compassionate release at this time."

The Court held a hearing on May 19, 2020 on Defendant Rahmel Garraway's ("Defendant") motion to extend the Court's temporary release order, dated April 20, 2020 (ECF No. 68), by 30 days. (See ECF No. 72.) Based on the information provided at the hearing, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion. In particular, the Court determines that, in light of the dire circumstances presented by COVID-19, a thirty-day extension of Defendant's "temporary release" to the "custody of" an "appropriate person" is "necessary" for a "compelling reason." See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i). The Court continues the bail conditions set by Pretrial Services, which include: The defendant shall be placed under 24-hour home incarceration at the home of Autumn Brown at 2 Lakeview Drive, Apartment D3, Peekskill, New York 10566, to be enforced by location monitoring technology determined by Pretrial Services- When home visits are scheduled by Pretrial Services, to the best of his ability, the defendant shall comply with Pretrial Services' requests to remove all cohabitants of the residents prior to the visit- The defendant must report and disclose to Pretrial Services when any cohabitant of the residence, including self, may be symptomatic of any illness- Travel limited to legal or medical appointments in the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York with Pre-Trial Services' approval- $100,000 personal recognizance bond, signed by the defendant and three financially responsible persons- Surrender of all travel documents or passports and no new applications- Pretrial supervision as directed by Pretrial Services- The defendant shall not commit a federal, state, or local crime during temporary release- and Any other conditions deemed necessary by Pretrial Services. Failure to comply with the above conditions shall result in the revocation of this Order. This Order shall be effective for a period not to exceed 30 days, at which time the need for continued release under the "compelling reason" that release was ordered shall be revisited by the Court. Defendant shall surrender to the Westchester County Jail by 11:00 a.m. on June 22, 2020, unless the Court finds prior to that date - pursuant to a letter motion filed by Defendant - that "compelling" reasons still exist to extend the Defendant's release. Should Defendant seek an extension of the release period for good cause, said application must be made fourteen (14) days prior to the expiration of the 30-day period and must be supported with a medical affirmation.

A telephone conference having been held today, with counsel for all parties and defendant participating, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: 1. Defense counsel shall notify the Court, in writing, as to whether or not the defendant waives his right to appear at a teleconference on the bail application- 2.

DeMaio in Support by Marco Caso as to Marco Caso, John Cicero, Irma Materasso, Eric Baker, Mathew Matteo re 31 MOTION Reply Affidavit. ENDORSEMENT: Application for bail is denied. Mr. Caso is facing serious charges that, combined with his extensive criminal history, qualify him as a career offender. Thus, his incentives to flee are obvious and substantial. This is on top of a record that shows many other failures to appear and overall disregard for the law, and a strong Government case built on, among other things, recorded conversations. Moreover, Mr. Caso's alleged conduct in this case also supports the Government's claim that he is a danger to the community. In the face of this, the proposed bail package does not rebut the presumption (including the "reasonability" standard counsel identifies and which the Government did not ignore). And, the reliance on the COVID pandemic is unpersuasive. Mr. Caso does not have any pre-existing conditions that place him in any risk categories and is well below the age threshold considered high risk. Moreover, as the Government points out, the record of WCJ in addressing the pandemic is one that shows the facility has had some success in containing the virus. Indeed, to contain the spread of the virus, WCJ has limited outside visitors and library access. While Mr. Caso complains about these measures, they are the ones that are meant to maximize the health of him and other WCJ inmates. In terms of trial prep, there is no reason counsel cannot communicate with this client via telephone and any speedy trial issues are premature at this point. Therefore, the application is denied, but without prejudice should circumstances change. Also, the Court finds that there is no need for argument, given that counsel have had ample opportunity to submit lengthy written submissions and include numerous affidavits.

On January 15, 2020, this Court sentenced Pantaleon to 20 months imprisonment, substantially below the Guideline Range of 33 to 41 months. Pantaleon surrendered to the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) on February 28, 2020 for the service of his sentence. Pantaleon has now filed a pro se motion seeking compassionate release because the COVID-19 outbreak "has made [him] very, very anxious" about the safety of his wife and three minor children, who currently reside in a shelter in New York City. (Def. Mot. at 1, ECF No. 208.) Pantaleon is 29-years-old.

Defendant acknowledges that he did not fully exhaust his administrative remedies before filing the motion. (Id. at 18-19). Inexplicably, defendant, who is represented by counsel, nevertheless filed the motion on May 20, 2020, one day before the exhaustion requirement would have been met. (Id. Ex. B). The Court does not have the power to waive the exhaustion requirement. See, e.g., United States v. Ogarro, 2020 WL 1876300, at *3-5 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 14, 2020- United States v.

Monsanto Lopez et al";"05/20/2020";"order-cr";"Order";"218  ";"Naomi Reice Buchwald";"MEMORANDUM AND ORDER as to Daniel Monsanto Lopez: Defendant Daniel Monsanto Lopez moves pro se for compassionate release from FCI Fort Dix, where he has served less than half of his 135-month sentence for conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine. Mr. Monsanto Lopez, who is 45 years old, argues that his sex, ethnicity, nonfunctioning gallbladder, hypertension, and family health history, in the setting of FCI Fort Dix during the COVID-19 pandemic, warrant his release. The Government opposes Mr. Monsanto Lopez's motion. Mr. Monsanto Lopez moves for compassionate release under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i), which permits a court to "reduce a term of imprisonment" if, after considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), "it finds that... extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a reduction... and that such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission." 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A). As the proponent of his release, Mr. Monsanto Lopez bears the burden of demonstrating that his release is justified under Section 3582(c)(1)(A). See United States v. Butler, 970 F.2d 1017, 1026 (2d Cir. 1992). While Mr. Monsanto Lopez's motion is long on statistics -- he emphasizes in support of his motion that COVID-19 has more strongly impacted Hispanic males such as himself -- it is short on specifics, and he has failed to demonstrate extraordinary and compelling reasons for his release. Mr. Monsanto Lopez is 45 years old, has 68 months remaining on his 135-month sentence, and he does not purport to suffer from, nor do his Bureau of Prisons medical records and pre-sentence investigation report dated May 4, 2018 evidence that he suffers from, a medical condition that the CDC has identified as a risk factor for severe illness from COVID-19. See Groups at Higher Risk for Severe Illness, CDC, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extraprecautions/groups-at-higher-risk.html (last updated May 14, 2020).Even if Mr. Monsanto Lopez could establish extraordinary and compelling reasons for his release, Section 3582(c)(1)(A) requires the Court to consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), which, for all of the reasons reviewed at sentencing, strongly counsel against releasing Mr. Monsanto Lopez, who was the organizer and leader of a sophisticated, years-long narcotics smuggling and distribution conspiracy that trafficked at least 20 kilograms of cocaine from Puerto Rico to the Bronx. The Court accordingly denies Mr. Monsanto Lopez's motion for compassionate release. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald on 5/20/2020) (lnl)"

Londonio et al";"05/20/2020";"order-cr";"Order";"1028  ";"Cathy Seibel";"ORDER denying motion for reconsideration as to Joseph Dinapoli: I am confused by counsel's statement that Defendant did not seek a sentence reduction. He moved under 18 USC 3582(c)(1)(A), which permits the court to "reduce the term of imprisonment." If he meant to ask to serve his sentence on home confinement under 18 USC 3624(c), he applied to the wrong place, as the Bureau of Prisons, not the Court, has the authority under that statute. To the extent Defendant seeks reconsideration based on his conduct while on pre-sentence home detention, that issue was addressed in my prior order, as was the treatment Defendant is getting for his diabetes. There is no constitutional right to the best imaginable treatment, or the same treatment an inmate got while at liberty, as long as Defendant is getting adequate treatment, which it appears he is. Of course, I encourage the medical personnel at MCC New York to review Defendant's case to make sure his diabetes is being properly treated. Finally, while I continue to regard a furlough as appropriate, I by no means think a furlough until the fall when planes may be flying is needed. It is about an eight hour drive from the Bronx to Butner, NC, and any furlough need only be long enough for a friend or family member to transport Mr. DiNapoli, provided FMC Butner is safe for him in terms of the corona virus..

Briccetti";"ORDER as to Darius Monroe (5): In an undated motion docketed on May 18, 2020 (Doc. #87), defendant Darius Monroe moves for a reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i). Section 3582(c)(1)(A)(i) authorizes the Court to reduce a term of imprisonment previously imposed for "extraordinary and compelling reasons." However, the statute contains an explicit exhaustion requirement that must be complied with prior to the filing of such a motion: "[T]he court, upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or upon motion of the defendant after the defendant has fully exhausted all administrative rights to appeal a failure of the Bureau of Prisons to bring a motion on the defendant's behalf or the lapse of 30 days from the receipt of such a request by the warden of the defendant's facility, whichever is earlier, may reduce the term of imprisonment... if it finds that... extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a reduction." Defendant does not claim to have exhausted his administrative rights. The Court does not have the power to waive the exhaustion requirement. See, e.g., United States v. Ogarro, 2020 WL 1876300, at *3-5 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 14, 2020)- United States v. Roberts, 2020 WL 1700032, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2020). Accordingly, the motion is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE to refiling after defendant demonstrates that the exhaustion requirement has been satisfied. Chambers will mail a copy of this Order to defendant at the following address: Darius Monroe, Reg. No. 85814-054 USP Canaan U.S. Penitentiary P.O. Box 300 Waymart, PA 18472.

ENDORSEMENT: Application for compassionate release under 18 U.S.C. Section 3582 is denied. Mr. Whitted does not present as many high-risk factors as he asserts. He is pre-diabetic, not diabetic, and while asthma is a risk factor, it is not in the top 10 risk factors in New York. And, while Mr. Whitted may be overweight, that is only among many factors that add risk, none of which Mr. Whitted has. On the flip side, Mr. Whitted's criminal history and his conduct in this case demonstrate that his early release would be of great risk to the public. He sold narcotics knowing full well that what he sold in particular was exceptionally dangerous. Moreover, while Danbury has had its share of challenges, they do not rise to the level of making Mr. Whitted's an extraordinary or compelling case for early release, especially given how much time is left on his sentence.

The Court denies Mr. Herrera's motion for three reasons. First, there is no indication that he has requested that the Bureau of Prisons bring a motion for compassionate release on his behalf. Mr. Herrera has accordingly failed to meet the exhaustion requirement of Section 3582(c)(1)(A), compliance with which this Court has deemed mandatory. See United States v. Pereyra-Polanco, 19 Cr. 10 (NRB), 2020 WL 1862639, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 14, 2020). Second, even if Mr. Herrera had complied with Section 3582(c)(1)(A)'s exhaustion requirement, he has failed to establish extraordinary and compelling reasons for his release. He is 34 years old and does not purport to suffer from, nor does his presentence investigation report dated June 11, 2018 evidence that he suffers from, a medical condition that the CDC has identified as risk factor for severe illness from COVID-19. See Groups at Higher Risk for Severe Illness, CDC, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extraprecautions/groups-at-higher-risk.html (last updated May 14, 2020). Moreover, while Mr. Herrera could care for his ill wife and son if he were home, his inability to do so while imprisoned is not an extraordinary and compelling reason for his release because it is an inherent feature of his sentence. Third, even if he could establish extraordinary and compelling reasons for his release, for all of the reasons reviewed at sentencing, the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) strongly counsel against releasing Mr. Herrera, who trafficked four kilograms of cocaine from New Jersey into New York City while in possession of a.380 Smith & Wesson handgun.

On May 18, 2020, counsel for defendant Richard Castro filed an unopposed motion seeking to adjourn the June 4, 2020 sentencing date. The application is granted. This Order responds to certain assertions in the May 18 motion and adjourns the sentencing date to July 16, 2020 at 10 a.m.The defendant pled guilty on July 25, 2019 to Counts One and Three of the Indictment pursuant to a written plea agreement with the Government. In that agreement, the parties stipulated to a Sentencing Guidelines range of 210 to 262 months imprisonment. The agreement acknowledged that the defendant faces a mandatory term of 120 months imprisonment. Sentencing was originally set for October 25, 2019. On October 11, 2019, the Court granted the parties request to adjourn the sentence. On April 9, 2020, the sentence was set for June 4. On April 17, 2020, the final Presentence Investigation Report was disclosed to the parties and filed. The May 18 motion indicates that defense counsel wishes to have witnesses travel to New York and provide testimony to the Court during a sentencing proceeding. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, such travel is not presently possible and defense counsel indicates that he has not been able to confer adequately with the defendant in preparation for the sentencing proceeding. Defense counsel also refers to the fact that inmates are not currently being moved to their designated institutions for the service of their sentence. Defense counsel is advised that the Bureau of Prisons will begin in the near future moving sentenced inmates to their designated institutions. Family members and friends of the defendant may submit letters in support of the defendant in connection with a sentencing proceeding, but they will not be permitted to speak at the proceeding. To the extent defense counsel has encountered difficulty in communicating with his client, he should seek assistance from the Assistant United States Attorney and if necessary from this Court. A defendant may also elect to be sentenced in open court or to be sentenced through a videoconference in which all participants will appear remotely. A form waiving the defendants right to be present in court for his sentencing is attached. IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that sentencing is adjourned to July 16, 2020 at 10 a.m. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Governments submission regarding sentence shall be due July 2, 2020 and the defendants submission shall be due July 9. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defense counsel shall advise the Court by June 26, 2020 whether the defendant wishes to waive his right to appear in court and to proceed to be sentenced through a videoconference.
