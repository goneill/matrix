Defendant moves for reconsideration asking that the Court treat his motion for bail as a petition for the writ of habeas corpus pursuant to Title 28, United States Code, Section 2241. In general, a Section 2241 petition must be brought in the district of confinement - which, in this case, is the Eastern District of New York. See, e.g., Goodall v. Von Blanckensee, No. 17-CV-3615 (KMK) (JCM), 2019 WL 8165002, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. July 19, 2019). Moreover, there is already a Section 2241 proceeding pending in the Eastern District of New York (in which there appears to be a telephonic hearing this morning at 11:30 a.m.) that could provide the relief that Defendant seeks. See Chunn et al. v. Edge, 20-CV-1590 (RPK) (filed Mar. 27, 2020). That said, the Section 2241 venue rule appears to be waivable. See, e.g., Skaftouros v. United States, 667 F.3d 144, 146 n.1 (2d Cir. 2011). Accordingly, no later than noon today, the Government shall file a letter indicating whether it has an objection to this Court entertaining Defendants motion. If it does, the Court will promptly deny the motion to allow Defendant to seek relief in the Eastern District (if that is necessary in light of the pending case). If it does not, then the Government shall file any opposition to the merits of Defendants motion by 6 p.m. today focusing on the exhaustion requirement and the merits of the petition, not on the motion for reconsideration standard.

The defendants are not currently in custody. Defendants have eleven attorneys of record, and Defendants have represented that seven of those attorneys expect to question witnesses or make opening or summation statements on behalf of their clients at trial. The trial has been adjourned four times, most recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is currently scheduled for September 3, 2020 and is expected to last approximately four weeks. Defendants and their attorneys are not available after this date for trial until November 2020. There exists a conflict with the current trial date due to Mr. Petruzzi's representation of the defendant, Mrs. Tupano, in the matter of United States v. Gypsy Tupano, No. 19-CR-20524 (S.D. Fla.). That matter is scheduled for trial from September 14 to 25, 2020, and Mr. Petruzzi predicts that the matter is unlikely to be resolved without a trial. The Government represents that the indictment of Mrs. Tupano was issued in late 2019 and Mrs. Tupano is not currently in custody. The Government, on that basis, requested that the Courts attempt to coordinate trial scheduling. Upon this Court's inquiry, Mrs. Tupano declined to consent to such communications to attempt coordination. This Court would welcome any accommodation that would enable both trials to proceed in a timely manner. It is ORDERED that Mr. Petruzzi shall inform Judge Cooke of this order and, by April 6, 2020, shall file a letter on ECF to inform this Court that she has been so informed. (Signed by Judge Lorna G.

Specifically, the Court scheduled two different start dates for trial: a tentative date of June 8, 2020, and a back-up date of September 14, 2020. (Id.). Given the numerous changes to the Courts docket occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the continuing uncertainty about the resumption of normal operations, the Court believes that it would be wise to finalize the September 14 start date for this case. Accordingly, the Court ADJOURNS the June 8, 2020 trial date and all of its accompanying deadlines.

P., a defendant need not be present for the arraignment if the defendant and defendants counsel have signed a written waiver of appearance and the Court has accepted that waiver. For those defendants choosing to waive their right to be present for the arraignment as provided in Rules 43(a) and 10(a), Fed. R. Crim. P., defense counsel was required to file a waiver with the Court by today. To date, one defendant, Prince Uko, already has been arraigned and one defendant, Ndukwe Anyaogu, remains at large. All of the other defendants, but one, have indicated a desire to waive their presence, and most have filed their waivers. The May 16 Order advised counsel that a trial date would be chosen at the May 8 conference. Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that the May 8, 2020 arraignment and conference will be held as a telephone conference. The parties shall use the following dial-in credentials for the telephone conference: Dial-in: 888-363-4749- Access code: 4324948. The parties shall use a landline if one is available. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that all defendants who wish to participate in the telephone conference may do so, and are encouraged to do so, whether or not they have waived their presence for an arraignment, that is, waived their right to be physically present in open court with the judicial officer at the time that the judicial officer conducts the arraignment. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that if defense counsel has already filed a waiver signed by both the defendant and counsel waiving the defendants right to be present at the arraignment, defense counsel need not submit the attached form, Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that any counsel who has not already submitted a waiver of the defendants right to be present at the arraignment shall promptly discuss the attached form, titled Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding, with their client. If there is informed and voluntary consent to waive appearance at the arraignment, by April 21, defense counsel shall file or mail to the Court the executed forms. Counsel are advised that in the event a defendant consents but counsel is unable to obtain the defendants physical signature on the attached form, the Court will conduct an inquiry on May 8 to determine whether it is appropriate for the Court to add the defendants signature to the form. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, should any defendant not consent to waiver of presence at the arraignment, a separate arraignment will be held with that defendant and that defendants counsel at such time as the COVID-19 health emergency abates and the court proceeding may be safely held.

The Government's sentencing submission shall be due to the Court on April 20, 2020. Having reviewed many submissions from Mr. Murray-Sesays counsel over thepast week, the Court offers the following observation: Based on the information available to it (which is concededly incomplete), defense counsel does not appear to appreciate the severity of his clients conduct in this case or his clients prior criminal history. The Court expects that, by the sentencing date, the defense will more fairly contend with both issues. The Court will conduct the sentencing telephonically, on its own conference line. Counsel for Mr. Murray-Sesay has indicated that Mr. Murray-Sesay wishes to waive his right to be physically present at his sentencing. (See Dkt. #63). Accordingly, the Court will only proceed with the sentencing telephonically if it is able to confirm, at such time, that Mr. Murray-Sesay's waiver is knowing and voluntary. See Fed. R. Crim.

The Court's decision in this case is based on, among other things, the unique confluence of serious health issues and other risk factors facing this defendant, including the defendant's age, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which place him at a substantially heightened risk of dangerous complications should he contract COVID-19 as compared to most other individuals. Accordingly, this Order should not be construed as a determination by this Court that pretrial detention is unsafe or otherwise inappropriate as a general matter or in any other specific case. 2. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i), the Court concludes that compelling reasons exist for temporary release of the defendant from custody during the current public health crisis. Accordingly, the defendant's application is GRANTED pursuant to the following conditions: The Clerk of Court is directed to prepare a personal recognizance bond with the following conditions of release: a. A personal recognizance bond in the amount of $50,000, to be signed by the defendant- b. All mandatory conditions of release included in this Court's standard "Order Setting Conditions of Release" form- c. Home incarceration at his marital residence at 20 Rigimar Court, Staten Island, New York, with montoring by means chosen at the discretion of Pretrial Services. The defendant shall be on 24-hour lockdown in his residence except for emergency medical visits and visits with his attorneys. Any other leave from the residence must be approved by either the Pretrial Services officer or by the Court on application from defense counsel. d. Pretrial Services supervision as directed by the Pretrial Services Office- e. Surrender all passports and other travel documents and make no applications for new or replacement documents- f. Drug testing and treatment as directed by the Pretrial Services Office- The defendant shall not possess a firearm, destructive device, or other weapon- h. The defendant shall not use or possess any narcotic drug or controlled substance unless prescribed by a licensed medical practitioner- 1. Upon the entry of this order, the defendant will be released directly from the Westchester County Jail, rather than being brought to the federal courthouse for release- j. Upon the defendant's release, the defendant must go directly to the Pretrial Services Office to be fitted with an electronic monitor, and then must go directly to his residence at 20 Rigimar Court, Staten Island, New York- and k. Within 24 hours of being released, the defendant will sign the bond and surrender any travel documents or firearms. 4. The Pretrial Services Office is directed to immediately alert the Court, the Government, and defense counsel of any violation of the above conditions, without need for a formal violation petitions. The defendant is hereby notified that violation of the conditions of release will likely result in revocation of this temporary release. 5. This Order is subject to modification or revocation by the Court at any time. The Court intends to terminate the defendant's temporary release, return the defendant to pretrial detention, and conduct the pending sentencing proceeding as soon as the Court concludes that the defendant no longer faces acute health risk posed by the current circumstances. 6. This Order is without prejudice to any future application by either party seeking to amend it. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Lorna G. Schofield on 4/3/2020) (lnl)"

McCarthy: Telephone Conference as to Willie Sims held on 4/3/2020. AUSA: Shiva Logarajah- CJA: Joseph Facciponti and Gaurav Talwar. Defendant consented to participate via telephone conference and this proceeding was held via a reliable teleconferencing service. Counsel shall file their letters in support of their bail arguments on ECF and are permitted to file the unredacted letters under seal. The Court finds that there is no combination of conditions that can be put in place to reasonably assure the defendant's appearance or the safety of the community and denies bail on the grounds of risk of flight and danger to the community. However, the Court further finds that temporary release of the defendant under 18 U.S.C. Section 3142(i) for compelling reasons is appropriate based on the defendant's increased risk of serious complications if he contracts COVID-19 given his current medical conditions and releases the defendant on bail for a period of time not to exceed 60 days.

The reasons for the denial were manifold and unequivocal. See ECF No. 15. Defense counsel filed a letter on March 31, 2020 informing the Court that the defendant appeared on a list of high risk inmates presumably because he is an asthmatic who has been prescribed an inhaler (when is unclear) who last had an attack (of unknown severity) approximately two years ago. See ECF No. 18. Like the Government, we treat the March 31 submission as a motion for reargument. However, our ruling does not depend on any technicality related to such a motion. Rather, we have directly considered whether the new, albeit undeveloped, information about the defendant's medical history should lead to a different result and have reached the conclusion that the answer is no. This new information in no way affects the issue of dangerousness or risk of flight, which given the documented inability of the defendant to conform his conduct to the law or direction, remain dispositive. As it is not necessary to reach the question of whether the defendant has proffered suitable conditions for housing upon release, the Court refrains from commenting on the appropriateness of his living with a pregnant woman given his expressed concern about exposure to the COVID-19 virus while in custody.

First, no visitors to McKenzie's apartment are to be permitted there while McKenzie is residing there. Only McKenzie and the other family whom the defense represents lives there McKenzie's two brothers, his mother, and the mother's boyfriend are permitted to be in the apartment. Second, McKenzie may not leave the apartment for any reason, except on the express written permission of Pretrial Services. Third, McKenzie is prohibited from using any electronic device or social media application except for the purpose of reporting to Pretrial Services or communicating with his counsel. The Court further directs that, on May 6, 2020, Pretrial Services provide an update to the Court on McKenzie's compliance with his conditions of his release and whether his return to the MCC is now safe for others. The Court further notifies counsel that it regards this episode as relevant to McKenzie's sentence. Under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), the factors a Court is to consider at sentencing include the defendant's "history and characteristics." The Court views McKenzie's actions, as shown on the video, as affording an illuminating window into his character. McKenzie's actions, at once, (1) revealed that, to obtain release, he had misled the Court by feigning genuine concern about contracting COVID-19- (2) disrespected his counsel, who with dedication and sincerity had advocated for his release, unaware that her client, once released, would behave recklessly with respect to contracting the disease- (3) exposed his family and friends to the risk of contracting COVID-19 from him, to the extent that he might already have contracted it at the MCC- and (4) mocked the efforts of other high-risk inmates in the MCC and elsewhere who without ulterior motives are today desperately seeking release from jail to reduce their risk of contracting this virulent disease that has killed thousands. The Court accordingly notifies counsel that, based on this dishonorable conduct, it is considering varying at sentencing above the guidelines range of 46-57 months imprisonment that the parties have agreed is applicable and from which each before this episode had agreed not to seek a variance. The Court invites counsel in their sentencing submissions to address these matters, including to provide any factual elaboration on them. Mr. McKenzie's sentencing remains scheduled for June 24, 2020, a date the parties should treat as firm. (Signed by Judge Paul A. Engelmayer on 4/6/2020) (ap) Modified on 4/7/2020 (ap)."

Because Petitioner has not yet made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right and because the Petition has not yet been dismissed in full, a Certificate of Appealability shall not be issued, see 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2)- Lucidore v.

Based on the most recently available information from the United States Marshal Service and the Bureau of Prisons, it is unlikely that the Defendant can be physically produced, either for an in-person sentencing or for participation in a telephonic sentencing. However, the Second Circuit has recognized, in cases such as United States v. Salim, 690 F.3d 115 (2d Cir. 2012), that a defendant can knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to be present at sentencing. The Court is unaware (i) whether defense counsel has discussed with the Defendant the possibility of his non-appearance at sentencing- and (ii) whether defense counsel has had a sufficiently robust waiver discussion with the Defendant to satisfy the dictates of Salim and the recently-passed CARES Act. The Court expects that any expedited sentencing will not proceed without Mr. Polancos waiver of appearance and an extensive colloquy of defense counsel regarding the circumstances of that waiver. Moreover, based on currently available information from the Bureau of Prisons, the Court advises counsel that it is unlikely that any transfers to designated facilities will occur in the near term. If the Defendant and defense counsel have contemplated Mr. Polanco's non-appearance at any sentencing proceeding, have had a robust waiver discussion, and wish to proceed with such an expedited sentencing, counsel should advise the Court no later than April 2, 2020. If not, defense counsel should advise the Court as to whether the developments discussed in this Order alter the request for an expedited sentencing, again no later than April 2, 2020. The Court clarifies that Mr. Polanco and defense counsel should discern nothing about the Court's ultimate sentencing decision from its willingness to schedule an expedited sentencing. The Court has made no decision regarding the appropriate sentence for Mr. Polanco. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 4/1/2020)(ap)"

"1:07-cr-00498-LJL";"USA v. Schaefer";"04/06/2020";"order-cr";"Order";"73  ";"Lewis J. Liman";"ORDER as to Alan Schaefer: The Court recommends that Mr. Schaefer spend the remainder of the time left on his sentence in home confinement at his apartment in Manhattan and that he spend 14-days in self quarantine at that apartment. It was not disputed at oral argument this morning that Mr. Schaefer satisfies the standards for home release and is eligible for home release now- the Government took no position in opposition to defense counsel's argument on those points. In the language of the statute, home confinement will provide the most reasonable, and under the circumstances perhaps the only opportunity for him to prepare for reentry into the community. Mr. Schaefer is also at a lower risk level. The offense for which his supervised release was violated does not justify him having to serve additional time at the MCC, with the grave risks that imprisonment there presents to his life and his health. As stated above, Judge Batts did not give him a death sentence. The Attorney General recognizes that the BOP can release a defendant to home detention without electronic monitoring if it is not available. Such authority is found in Section 3624(g)(2)(A)(ii), which provides: "If the electronic monitoring of a prisoner... is infeasible... the Director of the Bureau of Prisons may use alternative means of monitoring a prisoner placed in home confinement that the Director determines are as effective or more effective than... electronic monitoring...." The Government indicated at oral argument that it would not oppose such an arrangement. On the facts of this case, the Court recommends that the BOP do so. In the alternative, if the BOP determines not to exercise its authority under Section 3624(c), the Court recommends that Mr. Schaefer be granted a furlough and be permitted to reside at his New York apartment for a period of at least 30 days (the apparent statutory maximum) (with 14 days of self-quarantine at that apartment) with that period to be extended if possible during the duration of the Covid-19 crisis. The facts presented plainly support a furlough on grounds that Mr. Schaefer can obtain medical treatment at home that would not otherwise be available to him at the MCC. Furlough would further serve the purpose of enabling Mr. Schaefer to "engage[] in... [an] activity consistent with the public interest" namely, shelter in-place and isolate himself from others, thereby helping limit the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The Court also cannot ignore the health benefits to him, and to the public at large of his being released. What another court has said about civil detainees also pertains in this case to this criminal defendant: "Given the highly unusual and unique circumstances posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing crisis, 'the continued detaining of aging or ill detainees does not serve the public interest.'" Malam, Case No. 20-cr-10829, ECF No 22 at 42 (quoting Basank v. Decker, 2020 WL 1481503, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2020)). The United States Attorneys Office is directed to inform the Court by 6:00 p.m. on April 7, 2020, of the actions taken to inform the BOP of this recommendation and of the actions taken by BOP in response to this recommendation.

Without deciding the exhaustion issue, I deny the motion for compassionate release on the merits.... [See this Order]...

All other leave from the residence must be submitted through defense counsel for the Court's approval- Unless otherwise approved by the Court, the location monitoring equipment shall be installed no later than 14 days after release during which the defendant is ordered to self-quarantine- All mandatory conditions of release set forth in the standard "Order Setting Conditions of Release" form- No visitors to the residence except for family members and defense counsel- No contact with co-defendants under any circumstances- Travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York- Surrender of all passports and other travel documents and make no new applications- Pretrial supervision as directed- Drug testing and treatment as directed by pretrial services- No possession of any firearm, destructive device, or other weapon- No use or possession of any narcotic drug or controlled substance unless prescribed by a licensed medical professional- and Defendant to promptly inform pretrial services when any cohabitant of the residence, including himself, becomes symptomatic of any illness. Lopez's release is to occur only upon the satisfaction of all of these conditions. The Court finds these conditions, taken together, adequately protect the safety of the community and ensure Lopez's return for sentencing while minimizing the threat to his health. The stakes will be very high were Lopez to violate these conditions, even in the slightest degree. Lopez's counsel is directed to provide Lopez a copy of this Order as soon as practicable and to advise him that he could face the additional 9 crime of bail jumping were he not to comply with the conditions set forth this Order. Because his release is tied to the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, Lopez's release shall be reassessed every 60 days to determine whether the exceptional circumstances justifying his release have dissipated. To that end, not later than June 6, 2020, the parties must submit a joint letter discussing whether extraordinary reasons compelling Lopez's release continue to exist. No longer than 72 hours following his release from the MDC, Lopez and his counsel, along with counsel for the Government and the assigned pretrial services officer, must appear for a teleconference with the Court to ensure that Lopez fully understands the conditions of his release.

Such release to home quarantine is consistent with the protection of the health of the general public and with the BOPs efforts to address COVID-19 by prudently reducing the population of its facilities.

If the BOP anticipates that it will be unable to address the merits of Woodson's application, it should deny his application now and thereby open his pathway to seek judicial relief. For the agency to make the advance decision to allow the 30-day window to run out, but not to act to deny the application would be irresponsible. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge P.

Since his arrest on September 18, 2019, Mr. Pena has been detained at the MCC. On September 26, 2019, the Court denied Mr. Pena's initial bail application after concluding that he was a flight risk. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142. Citing COVID-19 and the evolving health crisis in the jails, Mr. Pena filed the present request for his release. On March 31, 2020, the Government opposed his application. Although the Court is concerned about the conditions in the MCC, Mr. Pena has not identified a reason particular to his own circumstances to reconsider the prior bail decision. For all the reasons stated during the September 26, 2019 bail hearing, Mr. Pena remains "undoubtedly a risk of flight." Gov"t Opp., Ex. A, Tr. At 14:16-17. For over 13 months after the Government unsealed charges in this case, Mr. Pena was a fugitive, appearing to live under an alias. In addition, as the Court previously noted when denying his initial bail application, Mr. Pena has a history of bench warrants and fraud convictions. Significantly, Mr. Pena's March 27, 2020 letter motion does not address the Court's finding that he is a flight risk nor offer any facts that would change that assessment. Furthermore, in citing COVID-19 as the changed circumstances now warranting his release, Mr. Pena does not identify any underlying health issue that puts him at a heightened risk for contracting the virus. As a final matter, Mr. Pena also argues that his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel is impaired because of the BOP's 30-day suspension of legal visits to the MCC. Mr. Pena, however, retains his right to speak to his counsel by phone, which is a suitable alternative at this time in light of the generally-accepted nationwide mandate against in-person meetings. See Pell v. Prounier, 417 U.S. 817, 826 (1974) (granting prison officials "latitude" in restricting visits "[s]o long as reasonable and effective means of communication remain open")- see also Groenow v. Williams, No. 13-CV-3961 (PAC), 2014 WL 941276, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 11, 2014) ("[D]istrict courts have found that a prisoner's right to counsel is not unreasonably burdened where a plaintiff has alternate means of communication with counsel." (collecting cases)). While the BOP is in the midst of a 14-day lockdown, it has represented that, to the extent practicable, it will continue to provide detainees with access to telephones and e-mail. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, Mr. Pena's renewed application for bail is denied. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Ronnie Abrams on 4/6/2020) (lnl)"

The issues relating to that question have been thoroughly discussed in Judge Nathan's very helpful opinion in United States v. Gross, No. 15-cr-769 (AJN) (S.D.N.Y. filed Apr. 6, 2020), so there is no need for immediate purposes for me to cover that ground again. Suffice it to say for now that: 1. The government shall file a letter immediately following any determination the BOP makes on defendant's request for compassionate release. The Court expects BOP to be able finally to resolve that request on or before April 15, 2020. If it has not done so, the Court will proceed to decide the motion pending before it after the further proceedings described below. 2. If the BOP has not finally resolved defendant's request in his favor on or before April 15, 2020, defendant shall file (a) language for a proposed modification of his sentence, and (b) any further submission in support of his motion, in each case on or before April 16, 2020.

That conclusion is no easier to swallow today than it was when Court made its initial ruling. As the Court explained then, "the balance of risks and benefits weighs heavily in favor of granting temporary release as Dr. Nkanga does not pose a danger to the community and is no risk of flight if released, yet he is plainly in grave danger at the MDC and, if infected, will pose a danger to others." 2020 WL 1529535, at *2. But the Court's constitutional obligation is "to apply the statute as it is written" even if it believes "some other approach might accord with good policy" or the exigencies of the moment. Burrage v. United States, 571 U.S. 204, 218 (2014) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Thus, if Dr. Nkanga is to get relief from the grave danger he faces as COVID-19 spreads through the jail and prison system, it must come from either the political branches or from a source of law other than Sections 3143(a) and 3145(c).

Nevertheless, upon review of the parties' submissions, including supplemental medical records submitted by Defendant yesterday, the Court GRANTS Defendant's motion and orders him temporarily released on bail. In particular, in light of the dire circumstances presented by COVID-19- Defendant's asthmatic condition, which exposes him to heightened risk in the event that he contracts the disease- and his lack of substantial criminal history, the Court finds, albeit narrowly so, that a "compelling reason" justifies Defendant's "temporary release" to the "custody of" an "appropriate person." See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i). Accordingly, the Court imposes the following bail conditions: $50,000 personal recognizance bond signed by Mr. Padin, who may affix his signature remotely within three hours of his release, and co-signed by two financially responsible persons, who may sign the bond remotely within one business day of Mr. Padin's release.

If the BOP anticipates that it will be unable to address the merits of Sayegh's application, it should deny his application now and thereby open his pathway to seek judicial relief. For the agency to make the advance decision to allow the 30-day window to run out, but not to act to deny the application would be irresponsible. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge P.

To its credit, the Office has elected, in some cases prompted by the COVID-19 emergency, not to invoke that doctrine, permitting the Court to order the release of inmate whose compassionate release application had been pending for less than 30 days. S e.g., United States v. Tia Jasper, No. 18 Cr. 390 (PAE), Dkt. 441 at 2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2020). The Court hereby notifies the USAO that, if the BOP has not, by April 22, 2020 granted compassionate release to Mr. Knox, the Court that day (barring unexpected intervening developments) will grant such relief as 30 days will then have passed and order Mr. Knox to be released from custody forthwith. Therefore, all that prevents Mr. Knox from being released now, as opposed to having to risk COVID-19 exposure in the MDC during the next two weeks, is the USAO's invocation to this point of administrative exhaustion. The Court accordingly directs that the USAO, if necessary at the highest level of the Office, give urgent thought to whether the seemingly elusive benefits of invoking that doctrine in this case outweigh the potentially catastrophic human consequences of deferring Mr. Knox's release by two weeks. The Court asks the USAO to notify the Court and the defense by noon on Friday, April 10, 2020, whether it continues to invoke administrative exhaustion in this case. (Signed by Judge Paul A.

The Court GRANTS Gentille's motion as follows: The Court modifies Gentille's previously-imposed term of imprisonment on Count One of Indictment 19 Cr. 590 (KPF) of six months' imprisonment to time served. The Court further orders that the BOP release Gentille immediately, and without regard to any quarantine provisions that might otherwise be applied, in order to reside at the apartment in Patchogue, New York. The conditions of supervised release originally imposed in Case No. 14 Cr. 608 (AJN), will now go into effect. The Court concludes by noting that this Order reflects its agreement with the parties' argument that Gentille would be safer from COVID-19 at Mr. Muller's apartment than at the MCC. It fully expects that Gentille will immediately self-quarantine, and that Gentille will maintain, on release, the same concerns for his health and safety and the health and safety of the community he is now reentering that were expressed so well by his counsel in the compassionate release motion.

While a conference is already scheduled in this matter for April 27, 2020, the Court agrees that a hearing on this matter should be held more promptly. However, based on information provided to the District Executive by the Bureau of Prisons, it appears unlikely that the Defendant could be produced for a video conference. The Court therefore orders the parties to meet and confer as to whether Defendant consents to a phone conference and whether the Defendant could be produced for a phone conference at specific date and time in the near future. If the Defendant can be produced for a phone conference and consents to a phone conference, he should sign and submit the attached waiver of personal appearance form.

Based on the record before the Court, it appears that the defendant's release to the custody of the mother of his children would endanger the safety of the community. The defendant was living with his family at the time he is alleged to have committed the very serious crimes with which he is charged. As described at the March 6 hearing, there is evidence that the defendant's drug trafficking included activity conducted from his apartment and that on at least one occasion he obtained the assistance of the mother of his children in doing so. The defendant also has not shown that his release is necessary for preparation of his defense. Trial is not set to begin for roughly seven months, and, in the meantime, the defendant is able to communicate with his counsel by telephone, as he already has done twice since his March 6 detention. The defendant also has not shown that his release would lessen any risk to his health presented by COVID-19. The defendant's request for release pending his November 2 trial, therefore, is denied.

Samet undoubtedly exhausted his administrative remedies, but it appears that the Warden denied Samet's petition long before the COVID-19 pandemic began. which means that there was no live administrative petition at any point during the pandemic and so no opportunity for the Bureau of Prisons to consider the impact of COVID on Samet's situation. This differentiates Samet's case from that of Mark Resnick, see United States v. Resnick, 2020 WL 1651508 (CM), where the petition was under administrative review during the COVID pandemic and the BOP was under orders from the Attorney General to consider COVID vulnerability in assessing compassionate release petitions. Samet should file a new administrative petition with the Warden, specifically citing his increased risk of complications from COVID-19 due to his age, which is above the CDC guideline for "older" persons who are particularly vulnerable to the disease.

Accordingly, this Order should not be construed as a determination by this Court that pre-sentence detention is unsafe or otherwise inappropriate as a general matter or in any other specific case. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i), the Court concludes that compelling reasons exist for temporary release of the defendant from custody during the current public health crisis. Accordingly, the defendants application for temporary release is GRANTED pursuant to the following terms and conditions $100,000 personal recognizance bond signed by the Defendant, who may affix his signature remotely within 24-hours of release, and co-signed by two financially responsible persons who may sign the bond remotely Home incarceration at 114-50 168th Street, Jamaica, New York 11434--the home of the Defendants sister, Carla Bowen--and enforced by electronic monitoring as soon as is practicable for Pretrial Services to install. In the event electronic monitoring is not immediately available, the defendants home incarceration shall be enforced as directed by Pretrial Services. The defendant shall be on 24-hour lockdown in the home except for emergency medical visits and visits with his attorneys. Any other leave from the home must be approved by either the Pretrial Services officer or by the Court on application from defense counsel. These conditions of release are temporary and ordered in light of the emerging COVID-19 crisis.

The evidence against the defendant on the current charges is strong, including video evidence, physical presence at location where drugs, distribution preparation equipment and firearm were seized, and seizures of large quantities of narcotics with which defendant can be connected. Defendant was on bail at the time from an out of state charge of possession of a large quantity of what is believed to be heroin. Defendant faces cumulative mandatory minimum sentences of 15 years on these charges. This record suffices to carry the Government's burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that no condition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure against risk of flight, and of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions can reasonably assure protection of the risk Defendant poses to the safety of the community.

Having proposed a prompt conference in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and that he would be willing to engage with the Government to develop a process that would permit the litigation to proceed in the wake of the pandemic. The parties might, for example have presented written proposals regarding the timeline for production and review of discovery, the proposed date for submission of motion and/or the next conference in lieu of an in person conference -- in sum, all of the procedural matters that typically take place during an initial conference before the district judge. Given the absence of feedback from Mr. Oskenhendler, the Court is unaware whether the defendant is willing to waive his appearance at a conference on April 10, 2020, and as a result will not schedule a telephonic hearing on that date. The Court will instead, schedule a hearing to take place on May 4, 2020 at 12:00pm. In the event that the parties wish to propose a schedule for the litigation in writing so as to obviate the need for a conference, they may write the Court in accordance with its individual rules of practice. The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate the motion pending at Dkt. No. 39. SO ORDERED ( Pretrial Conference set for 5/4/2020 at 12:00 PM before Judge Gregory H. Woods.)

Defendant's application to convert the scheduled sentencing hearing on April 16 into a telephone conference for the purpose of addressing the request for release on bail and the other matters referred to above is GRANTED. 3. Although it is implicit in defense counsel's application, by April 13, 2020, defense counsel shall explicitly advise the Court in writing whether defendant consents to appearing at the April 16 conference by telephone. 4. By April 13, 2020, the government shall file a response to defendant's requests (i) for release on bail, and (ii) for relief under Section 3582(c) (1)(A)(i). In its response, the government shall also advise the Court whether the government has considered or might consider allowing defendant to withdraw his guilty plea under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B) and instead to plead guilty to a violation of 21 U.S.C. §841(b)(1)(C). 5. The conference will be conducted by telephone conference call on April 16, 2020, at 2:30 p.m. The parties shall arrange for defendant's appearance by telephone.

Roberts, No. 18-CR-525, 20202 WL 1700032 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2020), I am without authority to order compassionate release at this time even if I wanted to, because Mr. O'Connor has not exhausted his administrative remedies. Indeed, this is a case in which information from the Bureau of Prisons would be helpful, given that his medical problems of which the Court is aware seem to be neurological and vascular rather than pulmonary. Further, because he has not served even half of his sentence yet, he may want to pursue a furlough rather than a sentence reduction.. See Roberts. For the foregoing reasons, Mr. O'Connor's motion for compassionate release is denied without prejudice to renewal if the BOP does not act upon his request within thirty days of its receipt. To encourage BOP to act on Mr. O'Connor's request expeditiously, the Court directs counsel for the Government to promptly serve this text order on the Warden and Chief Counsel of FCI Fort Dix..

The Court sentenced defendant Emil Rensing ("Rensing" ) to 51 months' imprisonment followed by 3 years' supervised release. (See No. 16 CR 442, Dkt. Minute Entry dated June 1, 2018.) Rensing is serving his sentence in FCI Otisville. By letter dated April 9, 2020, Rensing moved for immediate release from detention pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 3582(c)(1)(A)(i) ("Section 3582") and 28 C.F.R. Section 571.61. (See "Motion," No. 19 Civ. 5674, Dkt. No. 13.)...[See this Order]... While the Court must deny Rensing's Motion due to the statute's clear exhaustion requirement alone, waiting for BOP consideration of Rensing's request also would not necessarily be futile. The BOP has granted similar requests well within the statute's thirty-day limit and thus mooted substantially identical motions before this Court. See United States v. Arena, No. 18 CR 14, Dkt. No. 355. It is unclear that there will be any undue delay by the BOP, especially when less than one week has elapsed since Rensing made his request. Consequently, the cases cited by Rensing in support of the Motion do not compel a contrary result. The Court must deny Rensing's request. Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that the motion for compassionate release of Emil Rensing (No. 19 Civ. 5674, Dkt. No. 13) is DENIED without prejudice to refiling upon compliance with the terms of the statute. SO ORDERED. Signed by Judge Victor Marrero on 4/10/2020)(bw)"

Since the defendants trial will not commence for many months, it is premature to determine that the measures taken by the Bureau of Prisons to protect inmates health will prevent him from being ready to present his defense at that trial.

Briccetti";"ORDER - Petitioner has moved for leave to file an amended petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 in light of the Supreme Courts decision in United States v. Davis, 139 S. Ct. 2319 (2019), which was decided after the initial Section 2255 motion was filed in this case. The motion for leave to amend was docketed on March 16, 2020. (Doc. #18 in 19cv4130). The government has not opposed the motion for leave to amend. Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED: 1. Petitioners motion for leave to amend is GRANTED, without prejudice to any defenses the government wishes to assert. Petitioners amended Section 2255 motion (Doc. #16 in 19cv4130) is now the operative Section 2255 motion in this case. The government is directed to file its answer or other pleading in response to the amended Section 2255 motion by July 13, 2020. Because the amended Section 2255 motion completely supersedes and replaces the initial Section 2255 motion, the governments response shall fully address the arguments made in the amended Section 2255 motion as if it were the initial motion. If the government wishes to submit the Patel declaration dated December 5, 2019 (Doc. #13-1 in 19cv4130) as part of its response to the amended Section 2255 motion, it may do so. However, if in light of the arguments made in the amended Section 2255 motion the government believes that a new declaration is required from Mr. Patel, the government may obtain and submit such a new declaration. (See Docs. ##6-7 in 19cv4130). Petitioner shall have until August 13, 2020, to file a reply to the governments response to the amended Section 2255 motion. Absent further order of the Court, the amended Section 2255 motion will be considered fully submitted as of that date. Petitioners motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE. At this stage of the proceedings, there is no reason to believe an evidentiary hearing will be required in this case. Moreover, without making any final determination as to the merits of petitioners claims, a preliminary review of the amended Section 2255 motion indicates that petitioners claims lack sufficient merit to warrant the appointment of counsel. Finally, the Court has considered the type and complexity of this case and petitioners ability to present the case. The Court does not find any exceptional circumstances meriting the appointment of counsel at this time. All further papers submitted in this matter must bear both the civil docket number and the criminal docket number and must be filed in both dockets. The Clerk is instructed to terminate the motion for leave to amend (Doc. #18 in 19cv4130). Chambers will mail a copy of this Order to petitioner at the address on the civil docket.

As each Defendant's motion notes, the Second Circuit has "consistently, emphasized that this power [to grant bail to habeas petitioners] is a limited one, to be exercised in special cases only." Id. at 226. Here, the Court would not exercise its inherent authority to release either Defendant prior to the adjudication of a properly presented motion for compassionate release, because it would supplant the constraints built into the statute by Congress. More substantially, the Court has not yet decided that compassionate release is appropriate for either Defendant. The application raises substantial questions with respect to each of the Defendants in this case. Each was involved in a conspiracy to sell kilogram quantities of narcotics, and each has served only a relatively small fraction of his substantial sentence. The Court is not in a position now to grant either Defendant the relief that he seeks, even on a provisional basis. The Court expects to make a decision regarding the relief that is appropriate for each Defendant, if any, only after it has had the opportunity to review a fully briefed motion for compassionate relief filed on behalf of that Defendant, and the Government's response to the motion. The Court expects that briefing will address factors related to the Court's evaluation beyond the incremental risk to each Defendant associated with COVID-19.

Under 18 USC 3582(c), I may, after considering the factors set forth in 18 USC 3553(a), reduce a sentence if extraordinary and compelling reasons justify such action and it is consistent with the relevant policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. Policy Statement 1B1.13 imposes similar requirements, along with the provision that the Defendant not be a danger to the safety of any other person or the community. Application Note 1 to Policy Statement 1B1.13 describes four potential extraordinary and compelling reasons: 1) the defendant has a terminal medical condition or because of such a health condition is substantially diminished in his ability to provide self-care- 2) the defendant is at least 65 years old and has served 75% of his sentence- 3) family circumstances- and 4) an extraordinary and compelling reason other than or in combination with one of the above. Defendant does not suggest he meets any of the first three categories, but argues that the risk the corona virus pandemic poses to one with his health conditions meets the fourth category. While Defendant's medical issues appear to be primarily neurological and vascular, he also has COPD, a pulmonary condition that I assume puts him at higher risk. Nevertheless, having balanced the relevant factors, and acknowledging Defendant's increased risk, I do not find that a sentence reduction is warranted. The Bureau of Prisons has taken substantial steps to protect its inmates, and according to its website, as of today only 4 inmates and 2 staff at Fort Dix have confirmed cases of COVID-19 (and the Government represented on April 9 that the four cases then confirmed were in the camp, not the prison where Defendant is housed). BOP has also been providing Defendant with treatment for his conditions and there is no suggestion that that treatment has been inadequate. Further, Defendant has not even served half of his sentence (5 years on 17-CR-89 and one year for violation of supervised release on his federal conviction in Florida), which was fully justified by the 3553(a) factors. Finally, in light of Defendant's track record, he presents a danger to the community. Given his lifelong record of criminal activity -- including three federal narcotics convictions, the last of which was committed while he was on supervised release -- and his association with La Cosa Nostra, I do not trust that he will abide by the law if I reduce his sentence. He may be better advised to request from BOP a brief furlough during the pandemic.. (Signed by Judge Cathy Seibel on 04/13/2020) (Seibel, Cathy)"

Nevertheless, the Court recommends to the BOP, and in Mr. Millul's case, to ICE, that these agencies seriously consider these defendants as candidates for release under their administrative criteria. The Court does not view either defendant as a flight risk or a danger to the community, and release may well be warranted under guidelines that are more lenient than the "extraordinary and compelling" standard that binds the Court.

ENDORSEMENT: Pursuant to Section VII.D of the SDNY CJA Plan, and with the approval of the Chief Judge, Mr. Tomao is temporarily appointed under CJA for good cause shown, nunc pro tunc to 3/27/20. For the reasons set forth in United States v. Roberts, No. 18-CR-525, 20202 WL 1700032 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2020), however, I am without authority to order compassionate release at this time even if I wanted to, because Mr. Goodman has not exhausted his administrative remedies. Further, because he has not served even half of his sentence yet, he may have better luck pursuing a furlough rather than a sentence reduction.. See Roberts. A furlough strikes the Court as a reasonable way to address Mr. Goodman's documented pulmonary issues during the pandemic, and the BOP is encouraged to consider it. For the foregoing reasons, Mr. O'Connor's motion for compassionate release is denied without prejudice to renewal if the BOP does not act upon his request within thirty days of its receipt. Mr. Tomao is encouraged to serve a copy of this endorsement on the Warden and Chief Counsel of FCI Elkton. (Signed by Judge Cathy Seibel on 4/14/2020) (ap)"

Deruggiero et al";"04/14/2020";"order";"Order on Letter Motion";"46  ";"Cathy Seibel";"ORDER denying without prejudice 42 LETTER MOTION for compassionate release as to Salvatore Deruggiero (1): The first issue is whether and when Mr. DeRuggiero made an application for compassionate release to the Bureau of Prisons. BOP says he has not made such an application. Mr. DeRuggiero says that not only has he done so, but 30 days have elapsed since he did. I find his claim unlikely. Mr. DeRuggiero's letter to me is dated 3/26/20, so if he were correct, he would have made his application for compassionate release on or before 2/24/20. Had he done so, he would have been more prescient about the corona virus than most public officials. Further, he told a health provider on 3/30/20 that he had had bronchitis for 2+ weeks, which means he did not develop the condition until well after 2/24/20. If the bronchitis is what justifies the application, he could not have made the application on or before 2/24/20. I thus find that Mr. DeRuggiero has not exhausted his administrative remedies within BOP. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in United States v. Roberts, No. 18-CR-525, 20202 WL 1700032 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2020), I am without authority to order compassionate release at this time, unless the Government waives its objection, which it has not chosen to do. Accordingly, Mr. DeRuggiero's motion for compassionate release is denied without prejudice to renewal if he makes or has made a proper request and the BOP does not act on it within thirty days of its receipt. That said, Mr. DeRuggiero has already served 10 months of his 12 month sentence, and is suffering from a documented pulmonary problem (perhaps even COVID-19). This Court would have no objection if BOP were to furlough him for the remainder of his sentence, provided that he is not infectious and has an acceptable release plan in place for where he could self-quarantine safely. Likewise, I hope the Government will consider withdrawing its exhaustion objection.My chambers will send a copy of this text order to Mr. DeRuggiero..

The defendant also argues that his release is necessary to protect his Sixth Amendment right to counsel in advance of his trial, which is currently scheduled for May 18, 2020. The Government opposes the defendants release. The defendants application for release on bail is denied. An Order rescheduling the defendants trial date is forthcoming from this Court. Finally, the defendant argues that his release is necessary to protect his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. He cites the disruptions to the regular legal visitation schedule at the MDC. But, as described in the Governments opposition, the MDC allows telephone calls and email communications between counsel and clients, and the defendant does not argue that any such communications have been interrupted or cancelled. Given the current guidance on social distancing, it is unlikely that counsel would be conducting in-person meetings with the defendant in any event. The defendant's application for release is denied.

On September 16, 2019, Defendant Enrique Rivera a/k/a Eulogio Portes ("Portes") was arrested in the District of Massachusetts on a bench warrant that the Court issued in May 1987 after Portes failed to appear at sentencing for his role in a conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841. On February 4, 2020, the Court sentenced Portes to a term of imprisonment of one year and one day with credit for the time he had already served after his September 2019 arrest. To date, Portes has served approximately seven months of that 12 month and one day sentence. At sentencing, the Court noted that Portes suffers from multiple physical ailments, and it recommended that he serve the remainder of his sentence at Fort Devens, Massachusetts. (Judgment (Feb. 4, 2020), ECF No. 58.) Portes, however, was not transferred to the Federal Medical Center, Devens. Instead, he remains at the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn ("the MDC") where, as of April 14, 2020, four inmates and 13 staff have tested positive for the Coronavirus, COVID-19 ("COVID-19"). See COVID-19 Cases, Federal Bureau of Prisons, https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/ (last visited Apr. 14, 2020). The MDC has placed Portes on its list of "high-risk" inmates who are especially vulnerable to contracting the disease. On April 3, 2020 Portes (through his counsel) filed a motion ("the Motion") for a reduction in sentence to time served or home confinement on the grounds that the public health emergency caused by COVID-19 presents extraordinary and compelling reasons to warrant his immediate compassionate release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i). (Mot. for Reduction in Sentence or Home Confinement (Apr. 3, 2020), ECF No. 66.) The Government opposes the Motion on procedural and substantive grounds. (Letter from Thomas John Wright, Assistant United States Attorney, to Hon. John F. Keenan (Apr. 9, 2020), ECF No. 68.) The Motion was heard during a telephonic conference on April 13, 2020. The Court is dismayed to learn that Portes was not transferred to Fort Devens as recommended. Accordingly, before ruling on the Motion, and cognizant of the fact that the Court cannot dictate to the Bureau of Prisons ("the BOP") how the Executive Branch carries out a defendant's sentence, see, e.g., United States v. Kanagbou, 726 F. App'x 21, 25 n.1 (2d Cir. 2018) (summary order), the Court urges the BOP to forthwith transfer Portes to Fort Devens where, according to the BOP's website, there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19. See COVID-19 Cases, Federal Bureau of Prisons, https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/ (last visited Apr. 14, 2020). The Court also urges the BOP to expedite its consideration of Portes's petition for compassionate release, which his counsel represent they submitted to the Warden of the MDC on or about April 8, 2020. If the BOP elects not to immediately transfer Portes to Fort Devens, the Court hereby ORDERS it to inform the Court of where and how Portes will serve his remaining five months in the BOP's custody. Such information must be provided to the Court and the parties by no later than 12:00 p.m. on Wednesday, April 22, 2020. In the meantime, the Court recommends that Portes's counsel confer with the U.S. Probation Department for the Southern District of New York to ensure that their proposed location for a possible term of home confinement in Massachusetts is acceptable. Finally, upon receipt of this Order, the Government is directed to provide a copy to the BOP without delay. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge John F. Keenan on 4/14/2020)(bw)"

After a three-day jury trial, defendant Muhammad Waqar was convicted of one count of attempted enticement of a minor to engage in sexual activity in violation of 18 U.S.C § 2422(b). He was sentenced to 120 months' incarceration--the statutory minimum for such a conviction--and was remanded to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). (ECF No. 83.) After sentencing, he filed a notice of appeal, challenging his conviction and sentence. (ECF No. 85.) He then moved for release from custody pending appeal, relying 18 U.S.C. § 3143(b). (ECF No. 88.) Congress has directed that defendants convicted of certain serious crimes--including the crime for which Waqar was found guilty--be detained. See 18 U.S.C. § 3143(b)(2)- see also id. § 3142(f)(1)(B). Despite this strict mandate, a court may release a defendant if he "meets the conditions of release set forth in section 3143(a)(1) or (b)(1)" and "it is clearly shown that there are exceptional reasons why such person's detention would not be appropriate." Id. § 3145(c). The Court denied the motion because no such exceptional reasons were present. (ECF No. 98.) Waqar now moves for reconsideration of that order in light of "the newly discovered unprecedented threat of the COVID-19 virus." (ECF No. 99, at 1.) The government opposes the motion. (ECF No. 100.) The Court held a teleconference on the motion, during which defense counsel waived Waqar's appearance. For the reasons set forth below, the motion is denied....[See this Opinion & Order]... III. CONCLUSION: For the reasons discussed above, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Waqar's motion for reconsideration is denied. SO ORDERED: Signed by Judge Sidney H. Stein on 4/14/2020)(bw)"

My decision in this case is based on the unique circumstances of Defendant Gumora and the context in which his motion has been made, including: (1) the current COVID-19 pandemic and Defendants health conditions- (2) the underlying charges- (3) the status of the case- (4) the BOPs COVID-19 transmission mitigation measures- (5) Defendants RAP sheet- (6) Defendants history of violating the terms of his release from custody- and (7) Defendants specific history of threatening behavior towards women, and in particular towards the Victim, and the Mother. Accordingly, this Order should not be construed as a blanket determination so as to preclude the possibility that another defendants circumstances might present an appropriate basis for temporary release on bail. In other words, my decision is exclusively based upon the unique set of facts and circumstances of this case detailed in this Opinion & Order. For the reasons stated above, I find after balancing the reasons advanced for temporary release against Defendants risk of flight and danger to the community and specific individuals that temporary release is not appropriate under Section 3142(i)- therefore, Defendants motion is DENIED.

Such a simple correction, rather than a full resentencing, is warranted because Massa's Section 924(c) conviction had no effect on the sentence imposed for the two remaining counts of conviction. See United States v. Gordils, 117 F.3d 99, 104 (2d Cir. 1997) (finding that full resentencing may be appropriate "in the context of a 'truly interdependent' sentence"). The Court thus amends the judgment to find Massa guilty only of (1)racketeering conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(d), and (2) conspiracy to commit murder in aid of racketeering, in violation of 18 U.S.C § 1959(a)(5), and amends the sentence to 360 months' imprisonment.

Def. Letter at 1, ECF No. 57. To date, Defendant has not received a decision. Now before the Court is Defendant's request for an order directing the Warden of the MDC to expedite his decision on the pending request. Def. Reply at 1, ECF No. 60. The Court is persuaded that, in light of the specific danger posed by COVID-19 to Defendant's health due to his asthmatic condition, a more certain timeline is needed. Accordingly, the Court directs the Government to file, by April 20, 2020, at 12:00 p.m., a sworn declaration from a responsible officer of the BOP setting forth a firm date by which the BOP will reach a determination on Defendant's pending compassionate release application. Defendant's request for a court-imposed deadline, however, is DENIED. (Signed by Judge Analisa Torres on 4/15/2020) (ap)"

By letter dated April 7, 2020, Defendant Tony Garcia moved for compassionate release under the First Step Act of 2018, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. (Doc. No. 272 ("Garcia Ltr.").) The government opposes his motion. (Doc. No. 270 ("Gov't Ltr.").) Because Garcia has not yet exhausted his administrative remedies, his request is DENIED without prejudice. Nevertheless, for the reasons stated below, the Court recommends that the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") consider releasing Garcia to home confinement pursuant to its authority under 18 U.S.C. §§ 3622 and 3624(c)(2)....[See this Order]... Nevertheless, the Court is certainly free to make a recommendation to the BOP that it consider allowing Garcia to be immediately transferred to home confinement. While recognizing that the ultimate decision of whether to release an inmate to home confinement rests with the BOP, the Court recommends that -- in light of Garcia's personal medical history, the relative proximity of his expected release date, and the public health and safety considerations raised by the ongoing pandemic -- the BOP consider promptly placing Garcia in home confinement in order to mitigate Garcia's health risk, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 3622, 3624(c)(2), and the CARES Act. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motion pending at document number 272, and the government is directed to serve a copy of this order on the warden of the MDC and to the Regional Counsel of the BOP.
