See Dkt. No. 765. Accordingly, as the Court stated in its April 13, 2020 Opinion and Order, Dkt. No. 764, if Mr. Gross remains incarcerated on May 2, 2020, the Court will then grant his motion for compassionate release and order him immediately released from the custody of the Bureau of Prisons on that date. The Courtwhich presided over Mr. Gross's trial, sentenced him, and has now individually determined that Mr. Gross is neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community and that, due to his medical conditions, he is at a higher risk of severe illness if he were to contract COVID-19deems the Government's discretionary decision not to waive the statutory exhaustion requirement, and thereby prolong Mr. Gross's time in custody during the height of the pandemic, both unnecessary and dangerous. Indeed, the unnecessary and discretionary delay by the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York endangers not only Mr. Gross, but the broader community as well, given the increased possibility that Mr. Gross contracts COVID-19 prior to his now inevitable release by May 2. Because the Court will not permit a delay of his release beyond May 2, the parties are hereby ordered to meet and confer regarding Mr. Gross's release plan, including any necessary plans for a period of isolation either at USP Canaan prior to May 2 or upon his release. The parties shall also consult with the Probation Department about a proposed order of release. On or before April 20, the parties shall submit a joint letter to the Court outlining Mr. Gross's release plan, including plans for any period of isolation, as well as a proposed order of release.

By letter dated March 25, 2020 (attached hereto), and received by the Court on April 6, 2020, Defendant Franklin Nunez moved for release from incarceration in light of the COVID-19 pandemic ("Nunez Ltr."). Though the letter is not styled as such, the Court has interpreted Nunez's request as one for compassionate release under the First Step Act of 2018, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A). The government opposes Nunezs motion. (Doc. No. 72 ("Govt Ltr").) Because Nunez has not yet exhausted his administrative remedies, his request is DENIED without prejudice....[See this Order]... The Court recently examined the issues that Nunez's request for compassionate release raises in detail in United States v. Ogarro, No. 18-cr-373 (RJS) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 14, 2020), ECF No. 666. Specifically, the Court determined that "section 3582(c)'s exhaustion proscription" unambiguously "mandates that where the [Bureau of Prisons] has not submitted an application for a sentence reduction, a court cannot, under any circumstances, grant compassionate release unless the defendant has either 'fully exhausted all administrative rights to appeal' or waited at least 30 days from the receipt of such a request by the warned of the defendants facility.'" Id. at 6 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)). The Court further concluded that it lacked the authority to waive that exhaustion requirement. Id. at 710. Accordingly, because Nunez has failed to exhaust his available administrative remedies, his request for compassionate release is DENIED without prejudice. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Richard J.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Demaria's motion without prejudice. He may refile his motion once 30 days have passed from the date he submitted his petition to FMC Lexington or once he has exhausted his administrative remedies. He is directed to submit with any such motion documentation detailing his medical condition and the risk such condition poses with respect to contracting and surviving COVID-19. Fe Court must note, however, that the pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. Even though FMC Lexington is without detected cases of COIVD19 at the time of this Opinion and Order, that situation could change with very little notice to the Government, to the Court, or, most consequentially, to Demaria. At this moment, only the Bureau of Prisons can take the steps necessary to protect Demaria and his fellow inmates through compassionate release, furloughs, see Roberts, 2020 WL 1700032, at *3, and other tools at its disposal. "Realistically, the best perhaps the only way to mitigate the damage and reduce the death toll of inmates from COVID-19 is to decrease the jail and prison population by releasing as many people as possible." Id. (internal quotation and alteration omitted). Fe Court urges the Bureau to quickly take those steps necessary to protect those under its care. Fe Government is directed to serve a copy of this Opinion and Order on the Warden and Chief Counsel of FMC Lexington. The Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to terminate the motion, Doc. 217.

Having considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), the Court is satisfied that early termination of supervised release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e) is warranted by Mr. Iovinos conduct and the interest of justice. Accordingly, supervised release is terminated, and defendant Peter Iovino is discharged therefrom, effective immediately. The Probation Officer is directed to provide a copy of this Order to Mr. Iovino. (Signed by Judge Vincent L. Briccetti on 4/16/2020)(jw)"

Arias Villar is detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) after bail was denied. He now moves for temporary pretrial release under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i), which allows such release when necessary for preparation of the detainees defense or for another compelling reason. The Government opposes the release, saying that Arias Villar has not established a compelling reason that justifies his temporary release, and that the Defendant remains a potential danger to the community and a flight risk. Arias Villar is a 28-year-old man with no known underlying health conditions and who does not raise any argument that COVID-19 has interfered with his ability to prepare his defense.

(Dkt. #76). On April 7, 2020, the Government submitted its opposition to Defendant's motion. (Dkt #79). On April 8, 2020, the Court entered an Order requiring that the parties submit supplemental letters addressing certain specified issues. (Dkt. #80). The Government submitted its supplemental letter on April 12, 2020. (Dkt. #81). Defendant submitted his supplemental letter on April 13, 2020. (Dkt. #82). On April 16, 2020, the Court held a telephonic hearing during which it heard from the parties and rendered an oral decision on Defendant's motion. For the reasons given on the record during the telephonic hearing, Defendant's motion is DENIED. The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate the motions at docket entries 76 and 82. The Court understands that Defendant requested that the Bureau of Prisons (the "BOP") grant him a 30-day furlough pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3622 on April 14, 2020. The Court further understands that it may recommend that the BOP exercise its discretion to grant Defendant a furlough. See United States v. Roberts, No. 18 Cr. 528 (JMF), Dkt. #296 at 8-9 (S.D.N.Y. April 8, 2020). "Realistically, the best perhaps the only way to mitigate the damage and reduce the death toll [of inmates from COVID-19] is to decrease the jail and prison population by releasing as many people as possible." United States v. Nkanga, 18 Cr. 713 (JMF), 2020 WL 1529535, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 2020). As the parties have agreed, Defendant is at particularly high risk from the COVID-19 virus because he suffers from chronic asthma. The Court acknowledges that the BOP must also consider competing interests but, according to the BOP's own designation, Defendant is a high-risk inmate. (Dkt. #76 at 1). Further, the Attorney General has directed the BOP to "immediately review all inmates who have COVID-19 risk factors" to identify "suitable candidates for home confinement." Memorandum from Att'y Gen. William Barr to Dir. of the Bureau of Prisons, at 2 (Apr. 3, 2020). Defendant may well be a "suitable candidate," and the Court recommends that the BOP give Defendant's furlough application serious consideration as soon as is practicable. SO ORDERED.

ECF No. 84. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated substantial changes in the Courts trial schedule in order to ensure that jury trials can be conducted safely and practically. Accordingly, the trial scheduled to commence on June 1, 2020, is ADJOURNED to November 30, 2020. It is ORDERED that the time between June 1, 2020 and November 30, 2020 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A), in the interests of justice. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting the exclusion outweigh the best interests of the public and Defendant in a speedy trial, because such an extension is necessary to efficiently administer the Courts docket consistent with public safety, and because it will allow the parties to prepare for trial and continue to discuss a pretrial disposition. The deadlines for pretrial filings set out in the Courts February 20, 2020 Order, ECF No. 77, are ADJOURNED sine die. It is ORDERED that: 1.

The parties shall include with their proposed voir dire questions a brief description of the case and a list of names and places likely to be mentioned at trial, both to be read to prospective jurors during jury selection. At the time of filing, the parties shall submit two courtesy copies of the proposed voir dire questions, requests to charge, and verdict forms to the Court. In addition, the parties shall e-mail these materials, as Microsoft Word documents, to Torres_NYSDChambers@nysd.uscourts.gov. 3. At the start of trial, the Government shall provide the Court with three hard copies of its exhibit list, and two sets of pre-marked documentary exhibits and Section 3500 material assembled sequentially in a loose leaf binder, or in separate manila folders labeled with the exhibit numbers and placed in a suitable container for ready reference. 4.

CONCLUSION: For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Mr. Vigna's a motion to modify his sentence for lack of jurisdiction, without prejudice to renew if this Court re-obtains of jurisdiction. To the extent a indicative ruling may be available to Mr. Vigna under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure Rule 37(a), the Court further defers making a decision, as well as deciding any underlying issues of timeliness/exhaustion, to allow Defendant to make a compassionate relief application to the Bureau of Prisons under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A). The Court expects that the Bureau of Prisons will address Mr. Vigna's anticipated application under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A) prior to his pre-release transfer to the residential halfway house in Brooklyn, New York, which is currently scheduled for April 22, 2020. The Court directs the Government to inform the Court by April 21, 2020 of the actions taken by BOP in response to this Order. If BOP has not acted on Mr. Vigna's requested at this time, Mr. Vigna is granted leave to renew his request for an indicative ruling under Rule 37(a). The Government is directed to serve a copy of this Opinion and Order to FCI Otisville Warden James Petrucci as soon as possible.

It is now Monday, April 20, 2020, and the defendant reports that he has received neither the antibiotic nor the pain medication. If that is correct, the situation needs to be rectified immediately. The Court understands that personnel at the Westchester County Jail ("WCJ") have their hands full during the corona virus pandemic. But if the defendant has an infection, which I infer from the fact that an antibiotic has been prescribed, a three-day delay in providing it (and pain medication for the pain caused by the infection and by an unrelated dental condition), seems unnecessarily risky. It is hereby ORDERED that Defendant Devon Knight be provided today (April 20, 2020) with the pills ordered for him by the provider he saw last week, unless there is a valid medical reason why that should not occur. It is further ORDERED that personnel at the WCJ advise the Court by the end of today (by email to chambersnysdseibel@nysd.uscourts.gov) as to their compliance with this Order.

The Government does not oppose Mr. DeBello's motion and agrees that there are "extraordinary and compelling reasons" warranting his release. DeBello, seventy-eight years old, is nearing the end of a five-year sentence for conspiracy to defraud the United States and would, under ordinary circumstances, have been eligible for release to home confinement in about seven months. Since being injured as a result of a serious fall in 2019, DeBello has experienced numerous medical complications including a life-threatening bacterial infection, various respiratory problems, and additional falls. He suffers from diabetes and hypertension and is wheelchair bound. He has been hospitalized several times- his most recent hospitalization has lasted nearly three months. Medical personnel for the Bureau of Prisons have observed that he is unable to care for himself and to perform the ordinary activities of daily life on his own. These medical circumstances, without doubt, place him at a higher risk from the COVID-19 virus. The Court agrees with the Government and the defense that the combination of Mr. DeBello's serious medical conditions from which he is not expected to recover, his advanced age, his vulnerability to COVID-19, and his inability to care for himself within the environment of a correctional facility constitute an extraordinary and compelling reason for his release pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 1B1.13 Application Note 1(A)(ii)(I).1 The Court accordingly grants the motion and resentences Mr. DeBello to serve the remainder of his incarceratory sentence under homeconfinement at his residence, where he will live with the aid of a caregiver. The Bureau of Prisons is directed to release Mr. DeBello directly from the facility where he is hospitalized as soon as his family can facilitate his transportation back to his residence. SO ORDERED.

Further, while the Court acknowledges that incarcerated persons, like persons on naval vessels or in nursing homes, are at elevated risk, Mr. Scronic has not suggested that he suffers from any condition that places him at greater risk than any other prisoner, and given how little of his sentence he has served, he does not appear to be a promising candidate for compassionate release. But his motion for compassionate release is denied without prejudice to renewal if he makes an application to the BOP and the BOP does not act upon it within thirty days of its receipt.

The Court of Appeals has made it abundantly clear that a district court lacks jurisdiction to decide a second or successive 2255 motion to set aside a conviction on its merits. E.g., United States v. Nelson, 115 F.3d 136 (2d Cir. 1997). So if this were a 2255 motion to set aside a sentence imposed on Datta in Case No. 09-cr-0949, the Court would have jurisdiction to rule on the motion on its merits because Datta never has made a 2255 motion in that case. And on the merits, the motion would be denied because Datta was not a party to, and no sentence was imposed upon him in, that case. See 28 U.S.C. § 2255(a). On the other hand, Datta in fact obviously is attempting to set aside the sentence imposed upon him in this case, 11-cr-1102. In short, Datta is trying to parlay a clerical error into a get out of jail free card. Accordingly, one might well indeed, should regard this as an attack on the conviction and sentence in this case, in which case it is a second and successive application upon which this Court may not rule absent leave of the Court of Appeals. Accordingly, the Clerk shall transfer this motion to the Court of Appeals under Liriano. Refer to 20 cv 2330 (Signed by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan on 4/20/20)(jw)"

Given the fact that the Government previously informed the Court that the BOP had already approved Mr. Stahl's request for home confinement, and the U.S. Probation Offices in both the Southern District of New York and the Southern District of Florida had already approved his relocation request, the Government is hereby directed to provide the Court with an explanation from the BOP, including by way of affidavit from the appropriate representative, as to how the new DOJ guidance can affect these prior decisions. The Government shall do so no later than 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday, April 22, 2020. The Government shall also file a copy of the new DOJ guidance on the docket by that time. If it still does not have a copy of the new DOJ guidance by 5:00 p.m. on April 22nd, it shall provide the Court with additional details about the guidance including when it went into effect and who it applies to, as well as when it will be submitted to the Court. Additionally, the Court notes that to the extent he has not already done so, Mr. Stahl will have satisfied the exhaustion requirement of 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A) by April 23, 2020, i.e., 30 days after Mr. Stahl submitted his March 23, 2020 "Emergency Request for Coronavirus (COVID-19) Quarantine to Home Confinement.1 See Dkt. 50-2. Indeed, the Government previously appeared to acknowledge as much when it indicated that the BOP was "diligently working to review and respond to [Mr. Stahl's internal] requests by April 23. See Dkt. 51 at 1. Accordingly, to the extent the BOP does not intend to release Mr. Stahl as it previously committed to do, it shall decide whether to grant him compassionate release in light of his health conditions and COVID-19 no later than April 23, 2020. Finally, Mr. Stahl shall advise the Court as soon as possible, whether, if the Court were to grant his compassionate release motion, he would have any objection to the addition of a new condition of his supervised release, namely that eighteen (18) months of that supervised release term be served on home detention. If he has no objection, he shall promptly provide his consent to such additional condition of supervised release in writing to the Court. (Signed by Judge Ronnie Abrams on 4/21/2020) (ap)"

The Court has received defendant Quincie Bardel's pro se letter requesting that he be placed in home confinement in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. (ECF No. 175.)...[See this Memorandum Order]... That statute, however, allows for a sentence reduction only "upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or upon motion of the defendant after the defendant has fully exhausted all administrative rights to appeal a failure of the Bureau of Prisons to bring a motion on the defendant's behalf or the lapse of 30 days from the receipt of such a request by the warden of the defendants facility." 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A).

The Court is now in receipt of those "medical records" -- a four-page "Health Services Clinical Encounter" document that was sent separately to chambers and was received on April 20, 2020. In light of the inclusion of Defendant's private medical information in the document, the Court concludes that the presumption in favor of open records is outweighed by Defendant's privacy interest. See United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1051 (2d Cir. 1995). Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the four-page "Health Services Clinical Encounter" document shall be filed under seal.

Defendants request in the alternative, that the Court modify the terms of his supervised release such that he be permitted to serve the remainder of his term of supervised release in home confinement, is DENIED. (Dkt. #237). Defendant is not currently serving a term of supervised release. On February 10, 2020, Defendant pleaded guilty to having violated certain conditions of his supervised release. (Minute Entry for February 10, 2020). That same day, the Court revoked Defendants supervised release and sentenced Defendant to serve a term of six months imprisonment. (Dkt. #233). Thus, Defendants imprisonment is not a term of supervised release that could be modified pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e), but is instead a term of imprisonment that cannot be modified under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c).

On April 10, the Government represented to the Court that the Bureau of Prisons approved Ms. Park's request to be transferred to home confinement pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3624(c). See Dkt. 62. With its letter, the Government attached the BOP's official response, signed by FCI Danbury's warden, informing Ms. Park of this decision. According to defense counsel, BOP officials then represented that Ms. Park would be released on April 23, 2020, after she completed a 14-day quarantine in the facility. See Dkt. 64. As of today, however, the BOP has not set a release date for Ms. Park. See Dkt. 64. No later than today, April 22, at 5:00 p.m., the Government shall respond to Ms. Park's letter and renewed motion for compassionate release. In particular, the Government shall confirm to the Court that Ms. Park will indeed be released from FCI Danbury no later than tomorrow, April 23, 2020, as the BOP initially promised. To the extent that the BOP does not intend to release Ms. Park from custody by tomorrow, the Government shall submit an affidavit from the appropriate BOP representative at FCI Danbury explaining why it is refusing to transfer Ms. Park to home confinement, despite its April 9th decision to do so, and why the Court should not find that the BOP is acting in bad faith. As this Court previously noted in urging the BOP to promptly resolve Ms. Park's internal request, "the confluence of factors in this case" requires immediate action. Dkt. 60. First, Ms. Park has a documented history of respiratory issues, including asthma, and immunocompromising diseases, which, according to the CDC, puts her within the high-risk classification of those most likely to suffer serious, if not fatal, complications from COVID-19. Second, FCI Danbury, where Ms. Park is incarcerated, is suffering one of the worst outbreaks of COVID-19 within the BOP. As of today, 20 inmates and 31 staff have tested positive for COVID-19, see BOP, Open COVID-19 Tested Positive Cases (Apr. 22, 2020), https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/, and, according to defense counsel, one inmate has succumbed to the virus. Even the Attorney General recognized the heightened risk to inmates at FCI Danbury. On April 3, he issued a directive, acknowledging the "significant levels of infection at... FCI Danbury" and directing the BOP "to move with dispatch in using home confinement, where appropriate, to move vulnerable inmates out of these institutions." Office of the Attorney General, Memorandum for Director of Bureau of Prisons: Increasing Use of Home Confinement at Institutions Most Affected by COVID-19 (Apr. 3, 2020), https://www.justice.gov/file/1266661/download. In light of these factors and the prior representation made to this Court by the Government and the BOP, the Court expects that Ms. Park will be transferred to home confinement by tomorrow, April 23. Any further delay in acting upon the BOP's prior decision unnecessarily threatens the health and safety of Ms. Park. (Responses due by 4/22/2020) (Signed by Judge Ronnie Abrams on 4/22/2020) (ap)"

That said, the Court will obviously reevaluate if circumstances change materially or if the Defendant files a recusal motion. The Court agrees that Curcio proceedings are necessary if Mr. Mysliwiec is to continue to represent the Defendant and that sentencing (and all sentencing-related deadlines) should be adjourned sine die until such proceedings are concluded. That said, the Court is inclined to think that Ms. Williams - who does not appear to have been named in the lien - could serve as independent counsel to advise the Defendant with respect to the potential conflict with respect to Mr. Mysliwiec, obviating the need to appoint new counsel who would need to get up to speed on the complex history of this case and develop a relationship with the Defendant (a task complicated by the difficulties involved in communicating with inmates at this time). For that matter, one option - that independent counsel could and should discuss with the Defendant - is to simply allow Mr. Mysliwiec to withdraw as counsel and leave Ms. Williams to handle the sentencing alone, obviating the need for Curcio proceedings altogether. Counsel shall confer and, no later than April 24, 2020, at noon, submit a letter addressing these issues - specifically, whether Ms. Williams can serve as independent counsel for purposes of any Curcio proceedings or whether the Court should appoint new CJA counsel. Sentencing - and all sentencing-related deadlines - are adjourned sine die. The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate ECF No. 299. SO ORDERED (Signed by Judge Jesse M. Furman on 4/22/2020) (ab)"

After a jury trial, defendant Marko Stasiv was convicted of one count each of (1) conspiracy to commit bank and wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1349 (Count One)- (2) wire fraud affecting a financial institution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343 (Count Two)- and (3) aggravated identity theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1028A(c) (Count Five). (Doc 261.) On December 17, 2019, the Court sentenced Stasiv to 60 months' imprisonment on Counts One and Two, and 24 months' imprisonment on Count Five, to run consecutively, and three years of supervised release on Counts One and Two, and one year of supervised release on Count Five, to run concurrently. (Dec. 17, 2019 Sentencing Tr. (Doc 278).) The Court also ordered forfeiture in the amount of $122,424.92 and restitution in the amount of $548,178.70. (Doc 261.) Stasiv is presently incarcerated at the Metropolitan Detention Center ("MDC") in Brooklyn, New York. The Court is in receipt of three requests from defendant Marko Stasiv: (1) application for change of counsel- (2) application for a bail hearing pending appeal- and (3) an emergency letter motion seeking compassionate release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Each of these requests will be DENIED without prejudice. Defendant Stasiv's application for change of counsel is DENIED without prejudice to any application for a change of counsel made to the Court of Appeals. Defendant Stasiv's application for a bail hearing is also DENIED without prejudice. Stasiv has not made any showing of likelihood of success pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3143(b) that would permit the Court to find in his favor on a bail application. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and Stasiv's underlying health conditions are not bases to grant him bail pending appeal. Finally, for the reasons described at some length in United States v. Woodson, No. 18-cr-845, 2020 WL 1673253 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2020), the Court denies Stasiv's motion for compassionate release without prejudice for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. As this Court concluded in Woodson, the First Step Act provides a 30-day window for the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") to act and, only if a prisoner has exhausted his BOP administrative remedies or the 30-day period has expired, may a prisoner make an application to the Court. Id. at *1. There is no evidence that Stasiv has made any request of the MDC warden or otherwise begun the process of seeking administrative relief. Indeed, Stasiv's letter to the Court indicates that he has not submitted any BOP request for compassionate release, but instead seeks judicial relief only. Because Stasiv has not even commenced the requisite exhaustion of administrative remedies, his motion for compassionate release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A) is DENIED without prejudice. Should he fully exhaust his BOP administrative remedies and receive an unfavorable disposition, or submit a request to the MDC warden and not receive any decision within the 30-day window allotted to the BOP to act, Stasiv could then properly seek judicial relief. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge P. Kevin Castel on 4/22/2020)- Copy Mailed (by Chambers) on April 22, 2020 to defendant Marko Stasiv, Prisoner No. 75973-112, MDC Brooklyn, P.O.

By operation of and for the reasons stated in the Chief Judge's two Standing Orders of April 20, 2020, all jury trials in the district have been suspended until further order of the court, (M-10-468 (CM)- 20-mc-197 (CM)), and time has been excluded under the Speed Trial Act until June 15, 2020, noting that the period may be further extended as circumstances may warrant. (M-10-468 (CM)- 20-mc-196 (CM)). Accordingly, the trial date of June 1, 2020 is vacated. It will be rescheduled once the suspension has been lifted. Time is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act by operation of law until certain pre-trial motions are decided but, for avoidance of doubt, it is also excluded in accordance with the Chief Judge's Standing Order until June 15, 2020. The date for filing proposed voir dire, proposed jury instructions, Rule 404(b) disclosures, in limine motions, and responses to same is stayed until further Order of the Court.

Consistent with the longstanding practice in this district, the government consented to produce 3500 materials in advance of trial: [The Court]: Would it be convenient for the government to produce its 3500 material a week before trial? MS. LaMORTE: Yes, your Honor. We will endeavor to do that. Yes.(Transcript of Oct. 11, 2019 at 9). The government will be expected to live up to that commitment as to any new trial date.

Counsel for defendant is ordered to notify the Court no later than April 17, 2020 regarding the defendant's willingness to proceed by remote means in accordance with the CARES Act."

ENDORSEMENT: The Court will request a teleconference setting for the morning of Monday, May 4, 2020, that will permit the participation of both defendants, who are in custody in the MCC. The April 27, 2020, conference is adjourned, Because firm information regarding the time of the May 4, 2020, conference will not be available until late in the week of April 27th, counsel are requested to keep their calendars clear for 9AM to 2PM that day until further notice. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by an exclusion from speedy trial computations for the period from today's date through May 8, 2020, outweigh the best interests of the public and each of the defendants in a speedy trial because of the need for time to arrange a teleconference setting in which both defendants can participate during the current public health emergency.

"1:18-cr-00694-RA";"USA v. Stahl";"04/24/2020";"order-cr";"Order";"66  ";"Ronnie Abrams";"ORDER as to Lewis Stahl: As the Court has previously detailed, after Mr. Stahl filed a motion for compassionate release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), on April 17, 2020, the Government filed a letter indicating that the Bureau of Prisons (the "BOP") had approved his request for home confinement but that his relocation request was pending approval by the U.S. Probation Offices (the "USPOs") in the Southern Districts of New York and Florida. See Dkt. 56. On the morning on April 20th, the Court was informed by the USPO in the Southern District of New York that both districts had approved Mr. Stahl's relocation request. The Court then ordered the Government to advise it as to when the BOP intended to release Mr. Stahl to home confinement. See Dkt. 58. In response to the Court's April 20th Order, however, the Government filed a letter indicating that, in light of "new guidance" just issued to the BOP by the Department of Justice (the "DOJ"), the BOP now anticipated that Mr. Stahl was no longer eligible for home confinement or a furlough. See Dkt. 59. Given the BOP's apparent reversal of its prior approval of Mr. Stahl's home confinement request, the Court ordered the Government to provide it with an explanation, including by way of affidavit from the appropriate BOP representative, as to how the new DOJ guidance could affect those prior decisions. See Dkt. 60. Yesterday evening, the Court received the Government's letter, which, together with the Declaration of Jennifer Broton, Associate Warden of FCI Miami, represented that Mr. Stahl will be transferred to home confinement today, April 24, 2020. See Dkts. 65, 65-1. Based on these representations, the Court expects that Mr. Stahl will indeed be released today and transferred to his residence in the Southern District of Florida, where he will undergo a 14-day quarantine. By 5:00 p.m. today, the Government shall confirm with the Court that Mr. Stahl has in fact been transferred to home confinement. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Ronnie Abrams on 4/24/2020) (lnl)"

Defendant's high blood pressure is not information unknown at the time of the original hearing. To the contrary, Mr. Smith has been treated for it since last year, and apparently successfully, except when he does not take his medicine. Further, even if the high blood pressure were new information, it would not materially alter the balancing of the factors I undertook originally. I recognize that hypertension is a risk factor for COVID-19, and of course hope that Defendant stays free of the virus, but Defendant is getting appropriate treatment for his high blood pressure, and -- as summarized at the last hearing -- his record of (among other things) four prior felony drug convictions, committing the instant felony heroin offense while on federal supervised release, and repeatedly and recently driving while intoxicated, persuade me by clear and convincing evidence that there are no conditions of release that would reasonably assure the safety of the community.

As the parties have been advised, at that conference the defendants will be arraigned to the extent that has not already occurred and a trial date will be chosen. On April 10, 2020, the Court provided the parties with three alternative trial dates for their consideration. Ten of the eleven defendants have been presented and have either retained counsel or have had counsel appointed to represent them. One defendant remains at large. Prince Uko was arraigned on March 20. The remaining nine defendants have not been arraigned. All nine defendants have indicated their intention to waive their right to be present in court for their arraignment and have signed written waivers recording that fact. The Court understands that no defendant requires the assistance of an interpreter. At the May 8 conference, the Court will confirm in colloquy with each defendant that he or she consents to the conference proceeding telephonically, and that the nine defendants who need to be arraigned consent to their arraignment proceeding telephonically and without an opportunity to appear in person before the Court. Assuming such consent is confirmed, the arraignment of the nine defendants will then occur. After the outlines the nature of the evidence it intends to offer at any trial, the Court will consult the parties regarding the scheduling of the trial. After a trial date is selected, a schedule for motions will be set and the propriety of any exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act will be addressed. To assist in the conduct of the conference, it is hereby ORDERED that, if any of the defendants do not intend to participate in the conference via telephone, in other words, at all, counsel shall inform the Court by May 1, 2020. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that by May 1, 2020 the parties shall send to the Chambers email, CoteNYSDChambers@nysd.uscourts.gov, each of the telephone numbers that each defendant and each attorney will be using to access the May 8 conference.

The Court requires the BOP to inform the Court by 5:00 p.m. on April 27, 2020, whether Defendant will be granted a furlough, or whether the BOP will grant Defendant release on home confinement. If the BOP does not intend to grant Defendant a furlough, the Government shall submit an affidavit by 5:00 p.m. on April 27, 2020 from the appropriate BOP decision-maker explaining why the BOP initially stated that Defendant "will be approved for furlough.", and then later stated that, instead of being approved for furlough, Defendant is merely under consideration for furlough. If the BOP decides not to seek home confinement for Defendant, the BOP decision-maker shall submit an affidavit, by 5:00 p.m. on April 27, 2020, explaining why BOP first decided that Defendant "will be approved for home confinement," and later reversed its decision. The decision-maker shall also state whether there is a reason, in light of all of Defendant's circumstances, not to grant Defendant a deviation from the policy that prioritizes for home confinement those who have served 50% of their sentences, or who have served 25% of their sentences and have 18 months or fewer remaining on their sentences. If the BOP decides that Defendant should remain in custody, the Court requests that the appropriate BOP decision-maker also explain (1) what provisions (if any) will be made to isolate Defendant from other inmates without compromising Defendant's own health and that of other inmates- and (2) what provisions will be made to provide appropriate medical treatment for Defendant, in light of his COVID-19-positive status and his costochondritis, as well as his age and other underlying conditions.

Her sentence of incarceration is reduced to time served, and she is to be released from BOP custody effective immediately. On consent, Ms. Park shall be placed on supervised release status, with home confinement until June 19, 2021, the date on which she was expected to complete her custodial sentence.

See Dkt. 43. Finally, a word for Ms. Park's victims who object to her release. The Court shares your view that in light of the gravity of her conduct, Ms. Park deserves to spend every day of the sentence that she received in prison.

On April 12, 2016, the Government charged Devante Joseph in a four-count indictment. Dkt. No. 97. On December 12, 2016, he pleaded guilty to Counts One and Four, charging him with participating in a racketeering conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c) and brandishing a firearm in relation to a racketeering conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (1)(A)(ii) respectively.1 On April 12, 2017, the Court sentenced Joseph to 18 months imprisonment for Count One and 84 months imprisonment for Count Four, to be served consecutively, followed by three years of supervised release. On November 8, 2019, Joseph filed a petition to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 in light of the Supreme Courts decision in United States v. Davis, 139 S. Ct. 2319 (2019). Dkt. No. 2681. Josephs conviction on Count Four can no longer stand after Davis, because a racketeering conspiracy qualifies as a crime of violence only under the now-stricken residual clause of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(3). Davis, 139 S. Ct. at 2336. As noted at the April 23, 2020 resentencing in this matter, Josephs petition for a writ of habeas corpus is therefore GRANTED and his conviction on Count Four is VACATED. The special assessment imposed on Count Four under 18 U.S.C. § 3013 is also VACATED. The Court resentenced Joseph on Count One to 90 months imprisonment and three years of supervised release.

"1:11-cr-00581-JFK";"USA v. Miles";"04/27/2020";"order-cr";"Order";"102  ";"John F. Keenan";"ORDER as to Robert Lee Miles. Before the Court is an emergency motion by Robert Lee Miles for a sentence reduction to time served and his immediate release from the Metropolitan Correctional Center, New York ("the MCC") due to Miles's advanced age, compromised health, and his status as a medically "high-risk" inmate who is especially vulnerable to contracting the Coronavirus, COVID-19 ("COVID-19"). The Government opposes Miles's motion as untimely because he did not first fully exhaust his administrative rights under the applicable statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), before seeking judicial intervention.(See Footnote 1 on this Order). To its credit, however, the Government requests that, if the Court were to grant Miles's motion, the Court order (1) that Miles either be quarantined for at least 14 days or he be otherwise determined by the Federal Bureau of Prisons ("the BOP") to not have COVID-19, so as to protect the public- and (2) that the conditions of Miles's supervised release be modified to add a special condition that he reside in a residential reentry center--commonly known as a halfway house--so as to protect Miles, because allowing him to return to a homeless shelter, as Miles's release plan initially proposed, may increase his risk of exposure to COVID-19, given that many cases of the virus are reported to exist in such shelters. For the reasons set forth below, Miles's motion is DENIED....[See this Order]... Nevertheless, after considering the 3553(a) factors, given the kinds of sentences available, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(3), and Miless history and characteristics, id. § 3553(a)(1), including the significant behavioral issues that arose during Miles's recent stints in inpatient substance abuse programs and his prior and seemingly willful refusal to fully comply with the conditions of his supervised release, the Court is decidedly concerned that Miles's release plan will in fact place him at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19, effectively undoing the very reason for his compassionate release. Accordingly, the Court is not convinced that Miles has set forth the requisite "extraordinary and compelling reasons" to justify release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)(i), and his motion must be denied. If, however, Miles is able to propose a release plan that is acceptable to the U.S. Probation Department for the Southern District of New York, the Court will readily revisit this decision. Under those circumstances, the Court would urge the Government to consider whether waiver of the 30-day exhaustion requirement is warranted should its opposition either (1) not contest that extraordinary and compelling reasons may exist for immediate release- or (2) request a quarantine period that, when satisfied, would permit the defendant's release on a date more than 30-days after the defendant's initial request to the warden of the defendant's facility.SO ORDERED.

While there may be circumstances in which a court could be justified in excusing a failure to exhaust administrative remedies outlined above, a question on which I need not now pass, this Court declines to do so in all the circumstances of this request. This is not to say that the Court is unsympathetic to the concerns of inmates during this pandemic. But this is not an appropriate way to pursue compassionate release. The defendant himself is entirely free to apply for compassionate release within the BOP. He is free also to file his own motion with this Court. He may wish to contact the attorney who represented him in the criminal case for assistance. Application denied without prejudice. Defendant's counsel, Mr. Perlmutter, is directed to send copies of this order to the defendant and his sister. (Signed by Judge Lewis A. Kaplan on 4/27/2020) (See ORDER set forth) (ap)"

On April 23, 2020, the Court received a letter from Mr. William Bryant. In his letter, Mr. Bryant asks for the Courts assistance to get a prompt home detention date. The Court does not have independent information regarding the facts described in Mr. Bryants letter, but according to the letter, Mr. Bryant was eligible for home detention as of April 4, 2020. The Court does not construe this letter as an application for compassionate release under 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A). If it were, the Court would be unable to act upon it on this record because there is no indication that Mr. Bryant has satisfied the statutory preconditions to such an application those require that an inmate make a request to the warden of his facility to bring a compassionate release motion before requesting relief from the Court. The Court certifies, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(3), that any appeal from this order would not be taken in good faith, and therefore IFP status is denied for the purpose of an appeal.

He was also scheduled to see an orthopedist on 4/28/17. I was also informed that dental and optometric services are likely to be available in the next 30 days. In the pandemic I can imagine that physical therapy might be delayed, but I see no reason that Mr. Knight should not have at least gotten the knee brace within a week. The Government is directed to follow up with the Jail and report back to the Court no later than 4/29/20.

For the reasons stated above, because (1) I find that Defendant has not exhausted administrative remedies- and (2) I find that on the current record presented to me that Defendant has not sufficiently established extraordinary and compelling circumstances justifying the reduction in his sentence and his release from custody, Defendant's motion for compassionate release is DENIED. Although I deny Hart's motion, in part, due to his failure to exhaust his administrative remedies, because of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the BOP's staff and inmate population, I urge the BOP accelerate its consideration of Defendant's request for compassionate release. I direct the parties to provide this decision to the appropriate authorities within BOP so that they can consider my request to accelerate their review of Defendant's request for compassionate release. Defendant Hart is directed to file his initial motion papers on the docket, or to seek permission to file a redacted version of those papers. Because this Opinion & Order was decided based on materials related to Defendant's health or other information that should not be filed on the public docket, the Opinion & Order will be filed under seal. The parties are directed to meet and confer with regard to proposed redactions, and to propose redactions to me within the next thirty (30) days. I will then review the proposed redactions and if appropriate, implement them before filing the Opinion & Order on the public docket. If the parties do not submit proposed redactions within thirty (30) days, I will file the Opinion & Order in its current form on the public docket.

Consequently, proceeding without Mr. Buleishvili's consent, while it may be "initially justified because it harmlessly assisted the prisoner-movant in dealing with legal technicalities, may result in disastrous deprivation of a future opportunity to have a well-justified grievance adjudicated." Adams v. United States, 155 F.3d 582, 583 (2d Cir. 1998). Accordingly, no later than May 15, 2020, Mr. Buleishvili shall inform the Court whether he consents to the recharacterization of his claim as a § 2255 motion. If Mr. Buleishvili consents, he has until June 1, 2020 to supplement his claim. Any Government opposition is due July 15, 2020. Should Mr. Buleishvili not consent to the recharacterization of his claim as a petition for habeas corpus pursuant to § 2255, the Court will deny his request to file a late notice of appeal for the reasons stated above.

The combination of Mr. Hines's high incentive to flee in light of the potential 20-year mandatory minimum sentence, his apparent historic disregard of supervision restrictions, and access in the past to narcotics-related funds, and the current practical limitations on supervision methods and resources, demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that there is no condition or combination of conditions that will provide reasonable assurance against the risk of flight. The Government has also demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Hines presents a danger to the community that cannot reasonably be protected against by any condition or combination of conditions of release. The charges, which arise from gang-related drug sales involving firearms, are serious. The Government proffers that it has strong evidence in support of these charges in the form of the testimony of multiple cooperators who will testify that they engaged in drug selling with the defendant, were co-members of the gang, that all gang members had access to guns and used them to protect their turf, and that Mr. Hines bragged of having shot one of the guns. A social media posting showing Mr. Hines outside of a building central to the gang's drug activity, displaying a gang sign and with a legend indicating continued involvement in the activity, provides corroboration. Mr. Hines' criminal history includes a youthful offender adjudication arising from a shooting incident and a separate gang-related violent crime. He has demonstrated an unwillingness or inability to comply with supervision conditions, given that the current charged conduct appears to have taken place while he was on probation and under restrictions in connection with orders of protection.

Karas from Benjamin Gold dated April 17, 2020 re: Bail appeal pursuant to 18 USC 3145(b) and for release pursuant to 18 USC 3142(i), filed by Randy Sargeant. ENDORSEMENT: The application is denied. Judge Smith already held a bail hearing, where she found that Mr. Sargeant had not rebutted the presumption, based on the charges against him, that he was a danger to the community and she was skeptical that his community ties would assure his appearance at future court proceedings. Indeed, Judge Smith noted that the very people who were to be co-signors of a bond for Mr. Sargeant had been in his life while he was committing other crimes. He has a history of driving while intoxicated and has committed other serious crimes. These are indisputable facts that this Court independently concludes support a finding that Mr. Sargeant is a danger to the community. Moreover, the Government's proof appears to be substantial, and this proof exposes Mr. Sargeant to a mandatory minimum of 10 years' imprisonment. The main factor that Mr. Sargeant relies on to support a bail here is the COVID-19 pandemic and, in particular, his asthma. This is not sufficient to justify bail. Mr. Sargeant is young, and thus not in the age category that health officials have categorized as being at risk. Moreover, other than his asthma, he appears to be healthy. And, while asthma is a potentially serious respiratory condition, the latest data in New York show that it is not the risk factor that it was once believed to be. In fact, "when New York State, the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States, began releasing data on the top 10 chronic health problems suffered by people who died from coronavirus, asthma was notably absent from the list." (Danny Hakim, "Asthma is Absent Among Top Covid-19 Risk Factors, Early Data Shows," NY Times, Apr. 16, 2020.) This fact, combined with the efforts at WJC to control the virus, leave the bail application wanting. Accordingly, the application is denied without prejudice. (Signed by Judge Kenneth M.

"7:09-cr-00430-CS";"USA v. Desposito";"04/28/2020";"order";"Order on Motion for Miscellaneous Relief";"87  ";"Cathy Seibel";"ORDER denying 85 Motion for compassionate release as to Sonny Desposito (1): Under 18 USC 3582(c)(1)(a), I may, after considering the factors set forth in 18 USC 3553(a), reduce a sentence if extraordinary and compelling reasons justify such action and it is consistent with the relevant policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. Policy Statement 1B1.13 imposes similar requirements, along with the provision that the Defendant not be a danger to the safety of any other person or the community. Application Note 1 to Policy Statement 1B1.13 describes four potential extraordinary and compelling reasons: 1) the defendant has a terminal medical condition or because of such a health condition is substantially diminished in his ability to provide self-care- 2) the defendant is at least 65 years old and has served 75% of his sentence- 3) family circumstances- and 4) an extraordinary and compelling reason other than or in combination with one of the above. Defendant suggests that the meets the fourth category because he has suffered a broken arm that was not properly treated and did not heal properly, and because he suffers from chronic bronchitis and episodes of breathing difficulty that render him at elevated risk for COVID-19 while incarcerated. Mr. Desposito has not shown "extraordinary and compelling" circumstances. The most recent radiology report from the Bureau of Prisons (from January of this year) shows that his arm is "healed in satisfactory position." (Government Exhibit ("GX") C.) The bronchitis and breathing episodes appear to have been concocted in an attempt to fit within a COVID-19 risk group. Defendant's medical records make no mention of such ailments and in fact indicate normal respiratory function. Defendant's claim that he never mentioned his bronchitis because he "did not want to appear weak and sickly" is not believable. He provides no reason why he would care if medical personnel thought he was sick, and he apparently was willing to share with medical personnel that he suffered from conditions such as constipation, (GX J). Further, Mr. Desposito is one of the least credible individuals the Court has encountered. (See Doc. 80 at 4 n.3.) Although I recognize that prison is a risky place to be during a pandemic, it does not appear that Mr. Desposito is at greater risk than any other prisoner. Further, even assuming his medical conditions were as he alleges, the 3553(a) factors counsel against release. Mr. Desposito committed a bank robbery that terrorized innocent victims. He did so while on bail for another robbery. His crime involved the setting of three fires, risking serious harm. He then engaged in an elaborate and brazen scheme to obstruct justice. He then perjured himself at trial. He made numerous false statements in his application under 28 USC 2255, and he appears to have done so in the instant application. The Court has no confidence that Mr. Desposito would be law-abiding and not endanger the community were he to be released. The nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, and the need to protect the public from further crimes all, among other factors, justified the original sentence and continue to do so. The application is denied. My chambers will send a copy of this text order to Mr. Desposito. (Signed by Judge Cathy Seibel on 04/28/2020) (Seibel, Cathy)"

Thus, the application is denied without prejudice. Should Oliver fully exhaust his administrative remedies, or should any application to the BOP go without a response after 30 days, then Oliver may renew his application. However, Oliver will have to substantiate his claim that he has a particular reason to be at risk from COVID-19.

Karas";"MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Gregory Cooper on re: 179 LETTER by Gregory Cooper addressed to Judge Kenneth M. Karas from Clay H. Kaminsky dated April 23, 2020 re: Compassionate Release Reply to Supplemental Opposition. ENDORSEMENT: The Court grants the application for compassionate release. As noted in this letter, the application is now fully exhausted, based on BOP's denial of the application on April 17, 2020. As for the merits, it is undeniable that Cooper suffers from several medical ailments that individually and collectively place him in a high-risk category from COVID-19. As the data provided herein and in counsel's April 23, 2020 letter (citing a recent JAMA article) show, hypertension, obesity (as distinguished from morbid obesity) and diabetes are high risk comorbidity factors. The Government notes that Cooper is receiving treatment for his hypertension, but there is evidence that medical treatment for hypertension may add to the risk. See L. Fang, G. Karakiulakis, and M. Roth, "Are patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus at increased risk for COVID-19 infection," Vol. 8, No. 4 The Lancet, Apr. 1, 2020 ("Hypertension is...treated with ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which results in an unregulation of ACE2.... Consequently, the increased expression of ACE2 would facilitate infection with COVID-19. We therefore hypothesize that diabetes and hypertension treatment with ACE2-stimulating drugs increases the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19."). The Government also notes that Cooper is properly categorized as obese, and not morbidly obese, but this still places Cooper in a higher risk category. And, while it is true that pre-diabetes may be distinguished from diabetes, it hardly places Cooper outside the danger zone. Moreover, as counsel for Cooper notes, it is the combination of these medical conditions, plus the fact that Cooper is now in his 50s that places him in a higher risk category. While the MDC has undertaken substantial steps to address the spread of COVID-19, it is undeniable that the risks of spreading the disease are inevitably higher in a prison setting, where social distancing is much more difficult. Moreover, while Mr. Cooper committed serious crimes, which is why the Court imposed the sentence it did, Mr. Cooper has served 11 years of that sentence and is due to be released as soon as July 2024, meaning that he has served nearly 3/4 of the time of actual imprisonment (assuming he would receive good time credit). The Court also has considered that Mr. Cooper has an alarmingly bad criminal history, but believes that the risk of re-imprisonment from committing crimes while on supervised release should be a sufficient deterrent. Thus, the Court grants the compassionate release request. Cooper's supervised release conditions will be modified to include 18 months of home confinement to be enforced at the discretion of the Probation Department. All other conditions that were imposed remain. (Signed by Judge Kenneth M. Karas on 4/28/2020) (ap)"

In addition, the Court requires the Defendant to self quarantine in his daughter's home for fourteen days from April 30, 2020 and it requires home confinement until January 11, 2021. The Court will hold a status telephonic conference with the U.S. Probation Department, Counsel for the Defense and Government, and Mr. Musumeci on June 3, 2020 at 10:00 am. BOP Allenwood is respectfully directed to release Jeffrey Musumeci, Reg. No. 59877-054, to his daughter, Jessica Beatty on or before noon on April 29, 2020.

ENDORSEMENT: The application is denied. Defendant is facing a mandatory 10-year sentence based on compelling evidence that includes recordings and surveillance. Moreover, Defendant has a troubling criminal history, which includes use of a firearm and the commission of crimes while on supervised release. Thus, Defendant has not rebutted the presumption that there are no conditions that would ensure his appearance at future conferences or protect the public from the danger that he presents. With regard to his claim that he should be released because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Defendant does not suffer from any pre-existing health conditions that place him in any at-risk category and he is relatively young. Moreover, the Court is satisfied that the WCJ is undertaking measures reasonably calculated to minimize the risk of exposure to the virus.

Moreover, the Court took defendant's family circumstances into account when it sentenced her to 87 months' imprisonment (which was substantially below the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range) upon her conviction for conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute large quantities of heroin in and around Sullivan County, New York. The Court also took into consideration defendant's leadership role in the conspiracy, and the need for the sentence imposed to promote respect for the law and provide just punishment. The Bureau of Prisons has the authority in limited circumstances to transfer an inmate to home confinement, particularly in light of the current public health crisis. Therefore, Ms. Tompkins may wish to address her request to the Warden of her correctional facility. Chambers will mail a copy of this Order to defendant at the following address: Nordia Tompkins Reg. No. 77676-054 Federal Prison Camp Danbury 33 Pembroke Road Danbury, CT 06811. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Vincent L. Briccetti on 4/29/2020) (lnl)"

Wang denied Defendants application for bail, he filed an application before this Court. For the reasons stated on the record at todays telephonic hearing, I find that the Government proved by clear and convincing evidence that Defendant would pose a danger to the community if released. See United States v. Esposito, 309 F. Supp. 3d 24, 30 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (allocating burden for bail application of defendant awaiting trial). I also find that no bail condition or combination of bail conditions will alleviate this danger. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e). The Government proffered evidence demonstrating that Defendant is a drug dealer engaged in an ongoing and violent feud with a rival drug dealer. Furthermore, Defendants lack of legitimate income and lack of history of parental control demonstrate that confinement in his familys home will not assure the safety of the community or compliance with bail conditions. Thus, Defendants application for bail is denied. He shall remain detained pending further proceedings. An initial pretrial conference shall take place on June 17, 2020 at 10:30 a.m. For the reasons stated on the record, time is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A), until June 17, 2020.

In an Opinion and Order dated April 15, 2020 ("the April 15 Order"), the Court vacated the convictions and sentences of Defendants Jaime Rodriguez and Steven Camacho under the firearms statute, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c). The Office of the United States Attorney (counsel for the Government) and the Federal Defenders of New York (counsel for Defendants) were instructed to make written submissions with respect to the re-sentencing of the Defendants, attendant upon the April 15 Order. The re-sentencings will occur in the context of Defendants' convictions on substantive counts in the indictment unaffected by the April 15 Order's invalidation of the § 924(c) convictions....[See this Order]... As the letter briefs from counsel recite, there must be resentencing hearings in the case, a separate hearing for each Defendant. Rodriguez and Camacho each indicate through counsel a wish to participate. Given the restrictions imposed by the current pandemic, the Defendants state through counsel their willingness to participate from prison in a telephoned hearing. The Government's letter brief at 1-2 agrees with that procedure in principle, if the Defendants consent to it in practice. The Defendants express those consents in the letters of their counsel. A resentencing hearing by telephone conference call is the sensible procedure to follow in the present circumstances. The Court will hold a separate hearing for each Defendant. The attorneys will be heard in support of their contentions. Each Defendant may address the Court. A stenographic reporter should be present by telephone to record the proceedings. The Court will consider everything submitted by the parties, in writing or orally at the hearings. I will give first priority to this case, and make myself available for the hearings when these arrangements have been made. Rather than undertaking at this time to decree a date and hour for each hearing, I will in the first instance leave the necessary arrangements to counsel. To that end, the attorneys on both sides, who have conducted this important case with admirable professionalism, are directed to confer and cooperate in good faith, and eventually advise the Court of a proposed date and hour for each of the two hearings. I will preside by telephoning in to the arranged telephone conference. As they make these arrangements, counsel may be assured that I will accommodate the Court's schedule to whatever they propose. Given the circumstances of the case, counsel should expedite these efforts. It should be possible to hold the two hearings before May 15, 2020. If hearings have not been accomplished or scheduled by that date, the Court will set the dates for hearings by subsequent order. It is SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Charles S.

Davis, 139 S. Ct. 2319 (2019), invalidated as unconstitutionally vague part of Section 924(c)'s definition of "crime of violence" -- specifically, 18 USC 924(c)(3)(B). It left unaffected Section 924(c)'s definition of "drug trafficking crime" in 18 USC 924(c)(2).

According the Bureau of Prisons website, Defendants release date is not until 2023 which is presumably due to another sentence that Defendant is serving. Thus, it does not appear that there is any urgency in conducting the resentencing proceeding. Accordingly, and in light of the current public health situation, resentencing is SCHEDULED for September 16, 2020, at 3:30 p.m. in Courtroom 1105 of the Thurgood Marshall Courthouse, 40 Centre Street, New York, New York 10007... Finally, on June 6, 2019, Judith Vargas filed a motion to withdraw as counsel to permit Defendant to appeal, which motion does not seem to have been acted upon. In light of the remand and the need for resentencing, the motion is denied as moot. The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate ECF No. 12. (Signed by Judge Jesse M. Furman on 4/29/2020) (ab)"

(Dkt. No. 45-1.) On April 22, 2020, Canale renewed his motion for compassionate release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(a)(i). (Dkt. No. 42.) For the reasons that follow, Canales motion is granted. Canale is hereby RESENTENCED to TIME SERVED, and is ordered released from the custody of the Bureau of Prisons, effective immediately. Canale is hereby placed on supervised release status, with a special condition of home confinement until November 17, 2020. Furthermore, until November 17, 2020, and for three years thereafter, Canale shall be subject to all the mandatory conditions, standard conditions, and special conditions of supervised release from the original judgment and sentence in this case. The Clerk of Court is directed to close the motions at Docket Numbers 33, 41, and 42. (Signed by Judge J. Paul Oetken on 4/30/20)(jw)"
"7:16-cr-00302-KMK";"USA v. Jeffrey Herring et al.";"04/30/2020";"order";"Order on Letter Motion";"173  ";"Kenneth M. Karas";"MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to William Lewis (7) granting 167 LETTER MOTION addressed to Judge Kenneth M. Karas from Michael F. Keesee dated April 17, 2020 re: Amend Sentence. ENDORSEMENT: Mr. Lewis makes an application for a modification of the judgment in this case to one of time served. Officially, this is an application for compassionate release under 18 U.S.C. Section 3582, as recently amended in the First Step Act of 2018. Mr. Lewis was sentenced after serving as a cooperating witness, which resulted in a sentence substantially below the applicable Sentencing Guidelines. He is due to be released on June 6, 2020, which just over a month from now. Mr. Lewis argues for his early release because he suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure, which he says puts him a higher risk from contracting COVID-19. The Government opposes the application. The Court grants the application. It is beyond dispute that Mr. Lewis is at high risk from COVID-19, as the literature makes clear that diabetes is one of the most significant comorbidity factors and that is no doubt heightened by Mr. Lewis's high blood pressure. The Government counters this with an assertion that Mr. Lewis as refused to take certain medication, but that fails to address the fact Mr. Lewis is still a diabetic and is at risk. Moreover, counsel for Mr. Lewis, who has studied the medical records, counters that Mr. Lewis has only declined to take certain medication that, in fact, had not been prescribed at two other institutions, because that medicine had serious side effects. Mr. Lewis has apparently continued to take other medication and there is not evidence that Mr. Lewis has been on some campaign of self-destruction. Thus, this is no reason to deny the request. The Government also notes that Mr. Lewis' conduct in this case suggests he is a danger to the community and that he could infect those with whom he might live upon release. Both are fair points, but ultimately not persuasive. As for Mr. Lewis' danger, he is due to be released on over a month, so it is hard to understand how Mr. Lewis will be a particular danger in May, but not in June. The Government signed him up as a cooperator and chose to put him on the witness stand, and then filed the motions that allowed for a below-Guidelines sentence. And, as for any COVID-19 risk Mr. Lewis poses, that can be addressed by placing him in a 14-day quarantine. Therefore, after consideration of all the factors that the applicable statute requires to be considered, the Court grants the application. However, the Court modifies the supervised release conditions imposed at the time of sentence to require Mr. Lewis be subject to home confinement until August 31, 2020. (Signed by Judge Kenneth M. Karas on 4/30/2020) (ap)"

Defendant Jorge Rojas is currently serving an 18-month incarceratory sentence at the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn, after having pled guilty in January 2019 to one count of possession with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A). Rojas suffers from a number of serious medical conditions that place him at high risk of severe medical consequences should he contract COVID-19. On March 25, 2020, defense counsel filed a request with the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) outlining Rojas's exceptional circumstances and seeking defendant's transfer to home confinement for the balance of his incarceratory sentence.(See Footnote 1 on this Opinion & Order) (ECF No. 41.) On April 6, 2020, Rojas moved this Court for compassionate release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c). (Def. Mot., ECF No. 42.) Initially, the government opposed Rojas's motion on the ground that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as mandated by section 3582(c)(1)(A). (ECF No. 43.) The Court has held two telephonic conferences and has received written submissions on the motion...[See this Opinion & Order]... Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that: 1. Rojas's motion for compassionate release is granted as unopposed- 2. Rojas's sentence of incarceration is reduced to time served pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A)- 3. Rojas shall be released from BOP custody, effective immediately- 4. Rojas is hereby placed on supervised release, subject to the conditions of supervised release set forth in the judgment dated June 21, 2019. (See Judgment, ECF No. 38.) In addition to those conditions, Rojas shall serve the balance of his incarceratory sentence---Rojas's projected release date from the BOP is November 16, 2020---in 24-hour home incarceration enforced by location monitoring technology at an address approved by his Probation Officer. Upon release, Rojas is directed to go directly to Jacobi Hospital to be tested for COVID-19. If he tests positive, he will move into his late father's two-bedroom apartment at the address set forth in defense counsel's April 28, 2020 letter, where he will reside with his nephew and observe proper quarantine protocol. If he tests negative, he will reside with his mother at the address set forth in defense counsel's April 28, 2020 letter. Rojas may only leave his residence for necessary medical services. All other leave from the residence must be approved by Probation- 5. The location monitoring equipment shall be installed no later than 14 days after release- 6. If approved by Probation, Rojas is permitted to self-install the location monitoring equipment selected by Probation under the direction and instruction of Probation- 7. Rojas must obtain a smartphone with videoconferencing capabilities within two weeks of his release for remote/virtual monitoring by Probation- 8. Rojas shall comply with all standard conditions of supervised release- 9. Rojas shall surrender any personal travel documents not already in the possession of Probation and make no new applications for travel documents- 10. Rojas must immediately disclose to Probation when any habitant of his residence, including himself, becomes symptomatic of any illness- and 11. Rojas must report to Probation at the direction of Probation. SO ORDERED: (Signed by Judge Sidney H. Stein on 4/30/2020) (bw)"

For the reasons stated on the record at today's telephonic hearing, Defendant's motion is denied. The Government has satisfied its burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that Defendant would pose a danger to the community if released and proving by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant poses a risk of flight. See United States v. Esposito, 309 F. Supp. 3d 24, 30 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). Defendant's long and consistent criminal history demonstrates that he is a danger to the community. He has been convicted of seven felonies, including a violent sexual offense and weapons offense. Given Defendant's past bench warrants and failure to report to his probation officer, he is a flight risk. I also find that no bail condition or combination of bail conditions will alleviate the danger to the community or assure Defendant's presence in court. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e). Defendant would have to reenter the shelter system if released. He cannot provide assurance that he will have a consistent residence or a custodian to ensure his compliance with bail conditions. Additionally, his history of evading supervision poses a danger to Pretrial Services officers, who would have to step out into the community during a health crisis to find him if he fails to comply with bail conditions. Under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i), after a person has been detained pending trial, "a judicial officer may, by subsequent order, permit the temporary release of the person, in the custody of a United States marshal or another appropriate person, to the extent that the judicial officer determines such release to be necessary for preparation of the person's defense or for another compelling reason." Defendant argues that there is a compelling reason for his release because he has asthma, which places him at higher risk for severe complications arising from COVID-19. Additionally, Defendant says that restrictions in place due to COVID-19 have reduced his access to counsel. I find that temporary release is not appropriate because Defendant does not have an appropriate custodian or safe place to reside. Therefore, the motion for temporary bail is denied.

By letter postmarked March 17, 2020 and received by the Court on April 6, 2020, Defendant Randy Washington requests -- as the Court understands his letter -- early release or, in the alternative, a transfer to the Metropolitan Detention Center ("MDC") or Metropolitan Correction Center ("MCC") in New York City so that he can be near his family. (Doc. No. 163.) The government opposes the request. (Doc. No. 164.) Although Washington's letter is not styled as such, the Court has interpreted his request as one for compassionate release under the First Step Act of 2018, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), or for a transfer. Because Washington has not exhausted his administrative remedies, his request for compassionate release is denied without prejudice. As to Washington's request for transfer, the authority to designate an inmates place of imprisonment lies exclusively with the Bureau of Prisons ("BOP"), and not with this Court. See 18 U.S.C. § 3621. Accordingly, the Court also denies Washington's request to be transferred to the MDC or MCC....[See this Order]... Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT Washington's request for release or transfer is DENIED. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Richard J. Sullivan on 4/30/2020)(bw)"
