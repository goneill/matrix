Caproni";"MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Emanuel Falconer on 247 LETTER by Emanuel Falconer addressed to Judge Valerie E. Caproni from Emanuel Falconer, dated 4/22/2020, re: Compassionate Release. ENDORSEMENT: The Court views Mr. Falconer's request as a motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1). Mr. Falconer's efforts towards obtaining a GED and his participation in BOP programs are commendable, and the Court continues to encourage those positive steps. Mr. Falconer's ability to remain incident-free is also worthy of praise. Similarly, the Court is sympathetic to Mr. Falconer's desire to be with his family during these times. Nevertheless, the Court's authority to grant relief pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1) is narrow. First, Mr. Falconer must exhaust his administrative remedies by making a request to BOP for compassionate release before making an application to the Court- the exhaustion requirement is satisfied if BOP fails to take action within 30 days of the request. See 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1) (a). Even assuming that the exhaustion requirement can be waived, the circumstances in the letter are not sufficiently exigent as to justify a waiver of a statutory requirement that expires within 30 days. Finally, relief can only be granted pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1) if Mr. Falconer identifies "extraordinary and compelling reasons." Mr. Falconer's present circumstances do not constitute "extraordinary" reasons because he does not face a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 compared to other inmates, and his separation from his loved ones is a reality shared by virtually all other prisoners. Mr. Falconer's request for a sentencing reduction must therefore be denied. A copy of this Order has been mailed to Mr. Falconer by chambers staff. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Valerie E.

See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i).

That statute contains an explicit exhaustion requirement: "[T]he court, upon motion of the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or upon motion of the defendant after the defendant has fully exhausted all administrative rights to appeal a failure of the Bureau of Prisons to bring a motion on the defendant's behalf or the lapse of 30 days from the receipt of such a request by the warden of the defendants facility, whichever is earlier, may reduce the term of imprisonment... if it finds that... extraordinary and compelling reasons warrant such a reduction." Defendant concedes he did not fully exhaust his administrative remedies under Section 3582 prior to filing the instant motion. The Court does not have the power to waive that requirement. See, e.g., United States v. Roberts, 2020 WL 1700032 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2020).

Before the Court is an emergency motion by Defendant Enrique Rivera a/k/a Eulogio Portes ("Portes") for a sentence reduction to time served and his immediate release from the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn ("the MDC"), or, in the alternative, for immediate transfer to home confinement, due to Portes's advanced age, compromised health, and his status as a medically "high-risk" inmate who is especially vulnerable to contracting the Coronavirus, COVID-19 ("COVID-19"). Portes brings the motion pursuant to the First Step Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A) ("the Act"), commonly known as the compassionate release statute. The Government opposes Portes's motion as procedurally barred because he did not satisfy the Act's administrative exhaustion requirements before seeking judicial intervention, and substantively meritless because Portes's preexisting medical conditions, while serious, do not justify a reduction to the already lenient sentence the Court imposed less than three months ago. For the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that Portes is not entitled to relief pursuant to the Act because the provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c), which became effective on November 1, 1987, do not apply to his term of incarceration, which was imposed for criminal conduct that occurred prior to that date. However, Portes's motion is GRANTED pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b), in effect prior to amendment by Public Law 98-473 and applicable to offenses committed prior to November 1, 1987. Accordingly, Portes is to be released from the MDC tomorrow, May 2, 2020, and he is to immediately begin serving the remaining 138 days of his original sentence in home confinement, after first undergoing a 14-day quarantine, both of which must take place at the locations designated in Portes's April 23, 2020 letter to the Court. (See Letter from John M. Hillebrecht, DLA Piper LLP (US), to Hon. John F. Keenan (Apr. 23, 2020), ECF No. 72.)...[See this Opinion & Order]... III. Order: In view of the above, it is hereby ORDERED that Enrique Rivera a/k/a Eulogio Portes, Register Number 17330-054, is RESENTENCED to TIME SERVED plus 138 days of probation, which must be served in home confinement and monitored by such technology and on such conditions as the U.S. Probation Department for the Southern District of New York deems appropriate. It is FURTHER ORDERED that the following additional terms of Portes's probation are hereby imposed: 1. Portes must call his Probation Officer the day he is released, and he must strictly follow any instructions he receives at that time or in subsequent conversations. 2. Portes must call the New York State 24-Hour Coronavirus Hotline (1-888-364-3065) the day he is released, and he must strictly follow the medical and social distancing advice he receives. 3.Portes must strictly self-isolate from others at the Haverhill, Massachusetts location designated in his April 23, 2020 letter, (ECF No. 72), until at least May 17, 2020. 4.Immediately upon completion of the 14-day quarantine,Portes must reside at the Lynn, Massachusetts location designated in his April 23, 2020 letter, (ECF No. 72), until at least September 17, 2020. It is FURTHER ORDERED that Enrique Rivera a/k/a Eulogio Portes, Register Number 17330-054, be released from the MDC tomorrow, May 2, 2020. IV. Conclusion: For the reasons set forth above, Portes's motion for reduction in sentence or home confinement pursuant to the First Step Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A), is DENIED. However, Portes's motion is GRANTED pursuant to former Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b). SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge John F. Keenan on 5/1/2020)(bw)"

Nonetheless, his release date has not been set- but FCI Fort Dix has recommended that he be released on May 8, i.e., one week from today. The Court urges the BOP to promptly set a firm release date, and to allow the defendant to commence home confinement as soon as it is practical and safe for him to do so. Nevertheless, because the administrative process is proceeding in what appears to be a positive direction, the instant motion is denied as moot, without prejudice to renewal if the defendant is not released by May 8.

Rather, the Second Circuit dismissed those appeals on January 15, 2020. In particular, the Second Circuit dismissed Lasher's appeal from our Protective Order of June 3, 2019 for the lack of an arguable basis either in law or in fact. Given the dismissal ofher appeal, the Court finds no reason to hold a hearing to reconsider the merits of our June 3, 2019 Protective Order.

Defendant pled guilty to bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1344, and to wire fraud,in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343. (PSR 5- Dkt. Nos. 13, 14) He was sentenced to 120 months' imprisonment (Dkt. No. 16), and his release date is April 17, 2022. (Dkt. No. 50 at 2) On April 15, 2020, Defendant submitted a written request to the warden of his institution asking that he be released pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(1)(A). (Id. at 7) The Government contends that Defendant has not exhausted his administrative remedies and that exhaustion is mandatory. (Dkt. No. 50) Even if this Court were to reject the Government's exhaustion arguments, Defendants application would fail on the merits. Defendant is 33 years old and has no medical conditions that make him particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus. (PSR 104) Only one inmate at his institution has tested positive for the virus. (Dkt. No. 50 at 4 n.4) Defendants fear of contracting COVID-19 in prison standing alone is not an "extraordinary and compelling" reason justifying his release. See United States v. Simmons, No. 15 CR. 445 (PAE), 2020 WL 1847863, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 13, 2020) (denying compassionate release where defendant "does not fit into any heightened risk category for COVID-19").

While Defendant's asthma presents a degree of greater risk to Defendant in the event that he contracts COVID-19, that risk is not outweighed by the significant danger that Defendant's release would pose. This conclusion is based primarily on (1) the nature and seriousness of the charges in this case and the strength of the evidence, (2) the evidence that Defendant has been directly involved in shootings, and (3) the Defendant's serious and violent criminal history. "Simply put, the danger to the community presented by [Defendant's] release outweighs, substantially, the danger to himself presented by his incarceration."

Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic presently striking the Nation and the City of New York, Woodson argues that he has an enhanced risk of contracting COVID-19 at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) where he is currently incarcerated and, were he to contract the disease, his preexisting conditions would make it life-threatening to him.

The Court certifies under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(3) that any appeal from this order would not be taken in good faith, and therefore in forma pauperis status is denied for the purpose of an appeal.

Chan dated May 4, 2020 re: On March 16, 2020, the Court ordered the unsealing of Defendant Dajahn Mcbean's monthly supervision reports from November 2018 and December 2018 (the "March 16 Unsealing Order"), which was maintained under seal at the request of the Government in light of an ongoing law enforcement investigation, which had not yet been publicly disclosed. On April 21, 2020, the Court granted the Government's request to keep the March 16 Unsealing Order under seal for an additional 30 days (the "April 21 Unsealing Order"). On May 1, 2020, an indictment was unsealed charging the defendant and others with bank fraud conspiracy and aggravated identity theft. See United States v. Dajahn McBean and William Valdez, 20 Cr. 226 (KPF). As a result, the Government respectfully submits that continued sealing of the March 16 Unsealing Order and the April 21 Unsealing Order, as well as the ex parte applications by the Government in support of those orders, is no longer necessary. The Government further requests that these orders and applications be filed on the public docket. ENDORSEMENT: Given the government's representation that sealing of the documents identified herein is no longer necessary, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT the government is directed to file the ex parte applications previously submitted under seal on the public docket.

Medre et al";"05/05/2020";"order";"Order on Motion to Reduce Sentence";"275  ";"Cathy Seibel";"ORDER denying 272 Motion to Reduce Sentence as to Antonious Samuel (3): Under 18 USC 3582(c)(1)(a), I may, after considering the factors set forth in 18 USC 3553(a), reduce a sentence if extraordinary and compelling reasons justify such action and it is consistent with the relevant policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. Policy Statement 1B1.13 imposes similar requirements, along with the provision that the Defendant not be a danger to the safety of any other person or the community. Application Note 1 to Policy Statement 1B1.13 describes four potential extraordinary and compelling reasons: 1) the defendant has a terminal medical condition or because of such a health condition is substantially diminished in his ability to provide self-care- 2) the defendant is at least 65 years old and has served 75% of his sentence- 3) family circumstances- and 4) an extraordinary and compelling reason other than or in combination with one of the above. It is not clear whether Mr. Samuels has exhausted his administrative remedies. He says he applied for compassionate release on 4/4/20 and thus thirty days have run. The Bureau of Prisons ("BOP") says he did not apply until 4/22/20. I will assume for the sake of argument that Mr. Samuels has exhausted. Defendant suggests that he meets the fourth category listed above (extraordinary and compelling reason other than or in combination with one listed) because he has two medical conditions -- asthma and obesity -- that put him at increased risk should he be stricken with COVID-19. While his asthma appears to be mild and well controlled, given that his medical records apparently reflect that he rarely uses his inhaler, I will assume that the combination of factors he posits do put him at increased risk for serious illness should he contract the virus. The risk to him is less extraordinary and compelling than it would be were he housed at a different facility, because it seems there are no staff or inmate cases of the virus at FCI Schuylkill, although that could of course change. In any event, I still must balance the extraordinary and compelling reason Mr. Samuels posits against the factors set forth in 18 USC 3553(a). See USA v. Daugerdas, 2020 WL 2097653 (S.D.N.Y. 5/1/20). Those factors weigh against release. Mr. Samuels was sentenced to 60-months for managing a high-end cocaine operation, a role he took over after the original leader was charged with federal narcotics offenses. Mr. Samuels not only ran the business -- including obtaining supply, hiring workers and arranging sales -- but he funneled proceeds to his predecessor. His sentence of 60 months was appropriate, considering the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the Defendant, and the other 3553(a) factors. It would undermine several of those factors to release Mr. Samuels now, when he has served only about one-third of his sentence. Such a substantial reduction would have Mr. Samuels serving a sentence that is not just punishment. It would diminish respect for the law for an offender to get such a large reduction essentially because he is obese, and it would introduce unwarranted sentencing disparity. See Daugerdas. The Court believes, however, that Mr. Samuels' health could be safeguarded without undermining the 3553(a) factors by a temporary furlough under 18 USC 3622. Only BOP can order such a furlough, but the Court recommends that BOP give serious consideration to temporary release for Mr. Samuels, under proper conditions, after which he would complete his sentence. While Mr. Samuels' continuing the cocaine business after his boss was charged suggests he could be a danger to the community, he did not revert to criminal conduct while on pretrial release and the Court believes that he does not otherwise present a danger. (The Court notes that the community to which Mr. Samuels would be released -- Yonkers, New York -- has experienced a high level of corona virus infections, so suitable quarantine arrangements would have to be made.) A temporary furlough, rather than a sentence reduction, strikes the Court as the most fair and sensible balance of both the public interest and the risk to Mr. Samuels. The Government is directed to send a copy of this text order to the Warden and the legal department at FCI Schuylkill.. (Signed by Judge Cathy Seibel on 05/05/2020) (Seibel, Cathy)"

ENDORSEMENT: The Court is in receipt of the government's request for "any and all" of Defendant's monthly supervision reports to his probation officer. Having reviewed the reports, each of which is roughly one page long, the Court grants the request as to the monthly supervision reports for the months of November 2018 and December 2018 only.

Mr. Mena has not exhausted his administrative remedies and thus the Court could not grant the application even if it wanted to. See USA v. Roberts, 2020 WL 1700032 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 8, 2020). But even if he had exhausted, I would not grant the motion. Mr. Mena has not shown extraordinary and compelling circumstances under 18 USC 3582(c)(1)(A)(i), USSG 1B1.13 and Application Note 1 to USSG 1B1.13. He points only to the existence of the corona virus pandemic and the possibility he could be infected while incarcerated. This unfortunate fact -- which affects every prisoner -- does not alone suffice. He has pointed to no medical condition that puts him at elevated risk, and his facility is, at least for now, COVID-19-free. Finally, the factors under 18 USC 3553(a) militate strongly in favor of keeping Mr. Mena incarcerated. He has not served even half of his sentence- he has a serious criminal history- and he sold guns and heroin. His track record (including committing the instant offense while on federal supervised release and lying in his application under 28 USC 2255) makes it unlikely he would be law-abiding if released. The substantial sentence reduction Mr. Mena seeks, in the absence of specific peril to him from the virus, would undermine respect for the law, create unwarranted disparities, reduce deterrence and endanger the public. Accordingly, the application is denied. The Government shall send a copy of this text order to Mr. Mena and file a certificate of service or its equivalent on the docket (or advise my courtroom deputy if unable to do so)..

Dear Counsel: I am a Senior United States District Judge and the trial judge in the captioned case. I write this e-mail from my home in ########, rather than my chambers in New Haven (where I am presently posted, in the D. Ct.), because the courthouse is effectively shut down owing to the virus. As your files will reflect, Defendants Rodriguez and Camacho are currently scheduled to be re-sentenced, following the Court's vacating of their original convictions and sentences under section 924(c). Virus-related restrictions make it necessary to conduct the necessary re-sentencing hearings by means of telephone conferences. I am told that Rodriguez's hearing is scheduled for 11 a.m. on May 7. Camacho's hearing is scheduled for 1:00 p.m. on that day. I will be telephoning from home In order to participate in and preside over those hearings. I need to be given the number or numbers I must use to join the conference. Please e-mail those numbers to me at the above e-mail address: #########.com. Arrangements must be made to have a court reporter participate in the telephone conference so that a transcript of the hearing is made. During each hearing, I will hear, first, from counsel for the Government, then from counsel for the Defendant, and then from the Defendant himself (if he wishes to be heard). Counsel for the parties may then respond, if so advised. The Court will re-sentence Defendants after considering the entire record and all that has been said at the hearings. The transcripts of the hearings should be ordered on an expedited basis, the Government to bear the cost. Conducting a sentencing hearing in this way is not ideal, but the circumstances require it, and with the care and good will of all concerned, the cause of justice will be served. Every participant at the hearings should be sure to introduce themselves before speaking, and thereafter speak loudly and somewhat more slowly than they would ordinarily. I ask for this in order that everyone at the hearing hears everything that everyone else says, and an accurate transcript of the proceeding will be achieved. AT & T Conference Call number: (888) 363 4749. Access Code - 5216477. This e-mail should be understood as an Order of the Court. It will be docketed as such.
