ANTHONY:                  I call you every fucking day, like 5 times, 6 times, for the past few days.

JOHN:                     Oh, every day.

ANTHONY:                  I called you the day before I was leaving, left a message, "Call me." It was
important.

JOHN:                     And what happened?

ANTHONY:             I am in Staten Island now because the house isn't ready because the
inspector fucked it up. Now gotta wait until the 25th.

JOHN:                     Yeah, but you told me that.

ANTHONY:          No, I didn't tell you the 25th, we just got that yesterday. I didn't even tell my
mom yet, man. She'll fucking go nuts. They don't mind that we are there, but they don't want us
there. You know what I mean? I'm here too. I didn't go stay with Dino.

JOHN:                     You're staying with Dino?

ANTHONY:             No, I don't want stay there. My mom wanted me over there, she feels better
when I'm over there, you know. She feels like she's not wanted. They throw, you know, little hints,
you know. But I didn't tell them it's until the 25th now. I don't even want to tell her. I have to wait
until the inspector comes. I had to put things in storage. [Unintelligible] basement, he's good.

[Voices Overlap]

JOHN:                     Today is what?

[Voices Overlap]

ANTHONY:            You can put the stuff down. The basement was dirty. There was a new 10
foot area with new concrete and there was no stairs. It was all mud, the mud slide going down to
the basement. You know what I mean? When it's underground, like the side one they do, with the
stairs going down.

JOHN:                     They didn't clean it up?

ANTHONY:                  It had no stairs, no door, fucking raccoon prints all over.

JOHN:                What was the basement... why are they checking the basement? You are
not living in the basement.

ANTHONY:                  No, because all the stuff down there, all the stuff from the house, the moving
shit.

JOHN:                     Where did you put it?

 figure two times maybe, three the most? This you have to keep going over and over, you know?
 Yeah, because I had the hair a little long. But it still shouldn't take that long. When you do a
 swipe, like uh one swipe over, it should go down a lot. You know what I mean?

 UM9918:                     Yeah, what up?

 ANTHONY:                    You with him?

 UM9918:                     No, I never got over there. I'm going now.

 ANTHONY:                    Oh man. [Unintelligible] [Stutters] How fast $50 dollars? You have nothing?

 UM9918:                     Nothing, nothing hanging up here. I got people waiting all day.

 ANTHONY:                    That's how I am. Sick, bro. Fucking ridiculous.

 [Voices overlap]

 UM9918:                     Yeah, I'm gonna go to his house. I have to go there.

 ANTHONY:                    I gotta ask for this fucking shit...

UM9918:                   Nah, he won't get pissed. No, no, no. "Uh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry" that's what he says to
me.

ANTHONY:                  He's a fucking jerk off. Then we still gotta wait.

UM9918:                   No, no. I'm not waiting. I'm gonna go and that's it.

ANTHONY:                  Fucking piece of shit. But he told me "Don't worry, in the morning" yeah.

UM9918:                   The morning. Uh, he told you that?

ANTHONY:                  Came over here to collect that measly fucking 180 dollars. He came all the
way up to here.

UM9918:                   He came for it?

ANTHONY:                  Yeah.

UM9918:                   180?

 UM4135 TO                   ANTHONY

 UM4135:                     Anthony?

 ANTONY:                     Hello. You hear me bro?

 UM4135:                     Yeah, I hear you.

 ANTHONY:                    He's being a dick right now. If he calls me, I'll call you. I'm in trouble too now.

 UM4135:                     You know what I'm saying? You know how to put together a "hockey", right?

 ANTHONY:                    What?

 UM4135:                     Like the hockey, I don't understand some things about it.

 ANTHONY:                    Not right now. I'm trying to get through this kid bro.

 UM4135:                     Why do you got to fight with him? Just kiss his ass, bro.

 [Voices Overlap]

 ANTHONY:                    He's a jerk off. He's a fat piece of shit, that's why. He never changed.

 [Voices Overlap]

 UM4135:                     Just give in to him.

 ANTHONY:            Yeah, I know. He's a fat piece of shit, bro. He don't care about anybody but
 himself. Let him keep calling the phone. He said he was coming in a fucking hour.

 UM4135:                     But your moving to this kid's house though? So don't yell at him.

 [Voices Overlap]

 ANTHONY:                    Yeah, I know. Then he can't fuck around, cause I'm right there. Then he can't
 be a dick.

 UM4135:                     Don't yell around. Don't yell at him. Just say you know. Just tell him. Just ask.

 [Voices Overlap]

 ANTHONY:                    Let me keep calling, so I get it.

you said, you didn't need them." She said, "No I do need them." She said, "I need them..."

UM:                   [Audio Fades] He doesn't want it [Referring to the $100 for the pills]. I
mean, I tried to talk to him the other... that day.

ANTHONY:                  What's wrong with your voice?

UM:                       My voice, I was sick the other day.

ANTHONY:                  Damn bro, it's bad [Referring to his voice].

UM:                       I'm trying not to talk and like, I'm trying to relax today.

ANTHONY:             Well if anybody, if you could do it bro, [Unintelligible], she's been
screaming, " I don't want to live." It's bad bro.

UM:                   I understand that, but I don't know nobody. I don't know nobody with those. I
mean they happened to fall in my lap two weeks ago. If it was an every month thing or something,
I would I tell you. A couple of weeks ago 40 came through [Phonetic].

UM:                Forty of them, just happened to fall on my lap. Like I said, the kid does not
want to hear nothing.

[Voices Overlap]

ANTHONY:                  Wow bro, you sound like a freaking crazy person. You sound weird.

UM:                I know, I had a big argument with my brother Jimmy that's why. I was
screaming and yelling at the top of my lungs. I've been like this since [Phonetic] Tuesday.

ANTHONY:                You've been like that all week? No, I talked to you and you wasn't like that.
If anything bro, if it could happen, I'll pay 100 and I'll drive to you right away.

[Voices Overlap]

UM:                Anthony, Anthony, if I can get them, it will be a normal price. I'm not going to
take advantage of you.

ANTHONY:          That's what I'm saying, maybe if you enticed him, you know; you tell him
fucking $12 each, whatever.

UM:                 [Audio Fades] The person who's selling them, he's going to sell them at a
normal price. He's not going to sell them at no crazy price.

 ANTHONY:             Yeah, but I don't care, that's what I'm saying, if you would say that. maybe
 they will say, "Oh, sure, you know."

 UM:                  He don't care. You know what the kid told me, [Audio Fades]
 [Unintelligible] $100 per pills, I'm not selling them. That's what the kid told me. He's more
 concerned about his kid brother than anything. That's what he's worried about. I didn't bring it up
 to him no more, after he said that.

 ANTHONY:           It's fucking bad over here, it's making my mom sick too. [Unintelligible] It's
 nothing we can do.

 UM:                   I don't know what to say. If I know anybody, your mom [Phonetic] will be the
 first person. All right?

 ANTHONY:                    All right, bro.

 Because if we don't get them by the first, bro. Then I got to wait longer and my mother will not
 fucking survive it, bro. I wouldn't be able to stay there, so.

[Voices Overlap]

ANTHONY:         They don't. What? You don't know what happened? I didn't tell you what

ANTHONY:           No, yeah. [Stutters] Then she counted them wrong. She thought fucking I

Screaming, fucking yelling at me. Fucking... forget it, bro. Just get me out of here, bro. Get my
mom in her apartment. Please.

what are you gonna do? Pay it all back at once? That's what you plan on doing?

DINO:                No, that's not what I plan on doing. But if he gives you a 1,000 dollars dude,
that's 1,000 dollars off my bill.

DINO:                     No, I told him to give it to you.

ANTHONY:                  Give it to me?

here today. Where is he? He said he was supposed to pick me up and we are gonna come over
to see you, he said. I called him up. He said he'll call you right back and he never called back
and he told me the fucking U-haul truck was 600 dollars.

DINO:                     No, he told me 4.

DINO:                     No, he told me 4.

ANTHONY:              He told me 6 then I go, "Joe, you know that money, man? I would never lie
to you bro. That I miscounted." I said, 'There was 500 missing, bro. We were going to do
something about that, right?" He goes, "Yeah, I'll pick you up." When did he call me? Uh,
Saturday he called me. Oh you he called you up. Right after he called you and called me up. He
said, "I just spoke to Dino, "Blah, blah, blah, blah." He said, "The U-haul bill was 600." I said,
"600?"

[Voices Overlap]

DINO:                     He told me 4.

DINO:                     600 for what?

[Voices Overlap]

ANTHONY:            That's what I said. I said, "For what?" I said, "The truck was only 3 days
late." He goes, "No, the mileage on it." I said, "The mileage? What we really did, drive from
Brooklyn to his house, and then I drove it to my Aunt's."

[Voices Overlap]

DINO:                     And I told him it was going to be like 50 miles. That's not 50 miles.

[Voices Overlap]

ANTHONY:            Yeah, so 50 miles is only 200 dollars, bro. So say, 200 and 200... it should
be 400, like you said. 400. It should be around that.

DINO:                     That's what he said.

ANTHONY:                He told me 6. So, I don't know. That means he's a liar. If he did that, if you
told you 4 and told me 6. Maybe he was just getting riled up to fucking, to get you fucking... what
you call? To make you look stupid. He's like, "Oh, Dino, I don't know what he did with the truck. "
I got the bill. I got the what you call you call it? The notification. I'm like what the hell is this? He
actually paid it fucking like Friday or something. He waited that long, if anything maybe he got
late charges for not paying it. How the hell did he card anyway? [Pause] You there?

DINO:                     Yeah.

ANTHONY:                  Yeah, [Stammers] how did they put it? The only way we were all able to get
the truck, right?

DINO:                     Yep.

ANTHONY:                  Cause he put it on his card?

DINO:                     I guess so.

ANTHONY:            I don't know. I thought we were going to get away with it. Alright, so what
he's doing? Putting up the thing tomorrow?

DINO:                     Yeah.

ANTHONY:                  [Stammers] I gotta ask the inspector, is there electricity in the house right
now?

 ANTHONY:             Because the other guy, when I talked to him Friday... He said, one of the
 reasons why it could be... because he didn't know what was going on. He said the electricity has
 to be turned on. You know what I mean? Leave it on until I get there and then we'll switch it over.
 That's one of the thing, electricity and gas has to be working or else they'll fail it. The stove works
 too?

 DINO:                       Yeah.

 ANTHONY:                    So that's all that has to be done right now, it's the stair case? It's the dent?
 The Bannister?

 ANTHONY:                    I'm coming into Staten Island in a car.

 JOHN:              Okay, so... you just gotta go... [stammers] You gotta get off out of the car

 ANTHONY:                              You want me to hang up?

 JOHN:                                 Hylan Blvd and Narrows Rd.

 ANTHONY:                         Narrows Rd North. North, you gotta put. If I came in two buses I'll
 still be fucking waiting for the bus. I went to Brooklyn for nothing actually.

 JOHN:                          Yeah... but I had no idea this morning that I was coming to go
 fucking meet this guy and then I said " You know what? I wanted to get a haircut, perfect timing.
 So, let's see, I'm searching now.

 ANTHONY:                      I didn't have a phone I would've called at 12 o'clock and I
 would've stayed there I would've known. I shouldve called.

 JOHN:                                 You there?

 ANTHONY:                              Yeah. Hello.

ANTHONY:                       That's why.           Yeah I'm on the express so it shouldn't be

ANTHONY:                  So, is it going to be done Tuesday, so the inspector can come?

DINO:                     Yeah, on Tuesday bro.

ANTHONY:         Is the banister? We went down there, everything is done. They did the new
cement, they moved the line over. So what else? Just the banister and the boiler hooked up?

said you gotta put plywood on those 2 open windows.

DINO:                     Yeah right.

ANTHONY:                  Do you remembering this? The 2 open windows are for plywood.

[Voices Overlap]

DINO:                     Yeah, I'm remembering. What do you think, I'm an idiot?

ANTHONY:           They'll fail it. And you know that patch, that open thing, where you can see
the concrete on the other side? He said to put plywood on that too because they might say
something on that.

DINO:                     It's a separate address.

ANTHONY:          Oh so it's a separate address. The smoke detectors? He called up to
make sure, the smoke detectors, the boilers and the back and that's it. Then it's done.

DINO:                     What do you mean? Smoke detector are in there.

ANTHONY:           Yeah, I know that. That's what the Section 8 said. Make sure the Smoke
Detectors are in. The electricity. The gas is on, the water heater, the banister. He said those are
the most important things, then everything is fine.

DINO:                     Yeah, I know that. They are just making me fucking wait.

ANTHONY:                  So bro, you should let me know this bro.

[Voices Overlap]

DINO:                     I should have what?

[Voices Overlap]

ANTHONY:            Cause I would have got more money from him, bro. I would have got more
money to finish it.

leave." Outright. Then they gave us... they said, "You know what? We will give you another
week." Then Aunt Pat came up today starting again. How come I didn't go over. How come I
didn't go to Dino? How come I didn't go Dino today, how come I didn't go yesterday. I said, "I
went yesterday afternoon. What am I gonna go over there for? It's the same thing. It's not
finished."

 ANTHONY:                              I talked to him yesterday. He is like...

 JOE:                                  What did he say?

 ANTHONY:                           Everything he said that day , he wasn't home that morning. Which
 is bullshit first of all. And then he said that everything is paid off. He paid the plumbers and
 everything. They were supposed to come yesterday and to finish up and that they put him behind
 the list because he didn't pay the full price as he used to work for the company. But he said they
 supposed to be there and he said everything will be done by Tuesday. We'll see. I doubt

 JOE:                                  He said it'll be done by Tuesday?

 ANTHONY:                              That's what he is saying.

 JOE:                                  You know Let's go tomorrow.

 ANTHONY:                              You want to go tomorrow.

 ANTHONY and JOE talk at what time and when they are going to meet tomorrow to go to check
 the apartment.

 ANTHONY:                              I got to go to Brooklyn. Are you going to be to Brooklyn
 tomorrow?

 JOE:                                  No, I'll be in Manhattan.

 JOE says that after he is done in Manhattan he will go to SI. ANTHONY says that he can go to
 Brooklyn in the afternoon.

 ANTHONY tells JOE the talk he had with DINO.
