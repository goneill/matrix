ARLEEN and GRACE discuss the art work that Gustavo is supposed to do on the flyers. GRACE says
Gustavo said he was going to do the art work for ARLEEN but not the frames. ARLEEN says he is not
the only one doing art work, that she called him several times yesterday to see if they were going to be
ready, and he had said yes.
[Minimization start -11:27:54 - Minimization end -11:28:30]
ARLEEN tells GRACE that Gustavo told her that she has a lot of money. ARLEEN says that she is not
going to die if he tells her the art work is not ready.
GRACE advices ARLEEN to express herself a more proper way since she is now a business woman,
also be successful in her new career with other clients. ARLEEN says it is not the same thing because
she was taken for a fool by Gustavo, and it upsets her very much.
[Minimization start -11:30:20 - Minimization end -11:30:53]
They continue social conversation regarding the art work by Gustavo.
GRACE asks ARLEEN her whereabouts. ARLEEN says she is at home about to head out.
ARLEEN says that the way she feels right now if she was to catch Gustavo, she will shoot him in the face
about 30 times because she swears to God she is not going to get away with it, that it is not going to be
now but it could be in a or two year or what ever time goes by. ARLEEN says Gustavo will know who she
really is. ARLEEN says she has plenty of money to pay whatever amount they will charge her.
ARLEEN says Moreno is going over there to speak to him (Gustavo).
MORENO: [Background: I heard everything he said last night. I'm going over there, and he better
not tell me that it is not ready. I'm going to tell him.]
ARLEEN: Today I woke up very upset. Moreno is upset. I had the speaker phone on all the time. Moreno
heard all the shit he had said. He (Gustavo) should've told me from the beginning.
een
Social conversation about Gustavo wasting ARLEEN'S time, that she could've looked for someone else's
service.
GRACE advices ARLEEN to take things easy because she is a business woman now and that will ruin
her reputation as such.
MORENO: GRACE, do me a favor, because I know ARLEEN is very upset. Yesterday I heard his
entire conversation. Do me a favor, tell him... I ma going over there now. I'm going to get dressed. He
promised something to ARLEEN, and I am going over there. It's not about the person having money,
what matter is the responsibility. I know ARLEEN. I don't want ARLEEN to go over there because
anything can happen if she and I go. Tell him that I am going to go in person, because he is a man and so
am I. And tell him that I heard the entire conversation and the promise he made to ARLEEN over the
phone. I need that art. So I am going over there and I am going to sit down right over there. Also tell him
that I want him to go with me to the business place so he can see the sign because I noticed something.
That's it. No offense, but he has to do that art for me. So I am going over there now.
GRACE: While you get dressed... I'm almost done having lunch, so I ll go down there in a little bit.
MORENO: Do me that favor. I don't know the number, nor I'm going to talk over the phone. I'm
going over there, he is going to get in his car, I'm going to get in mine so he can see the work he did for
me. It's not about the person having money, but the person has to be responsible. He is a gentleman
and I am gentleman too. He is going to do me that huge favor without fighting or anything. It's me, not
ARLEEN. I'm the person that's going there. I have to leave to New York, so he has to do me those flyers
because he promised them for today... the art work. I want my art. I'll go anywhere. There are more than
enough printing shops in Puerto Rico, and I have more than enough friends in the printing business. Do
me that favor and speak to him, that's it. It's me, not ARLEEN. Me; JUAN VALDEZ. Alright?
GRACE: Alright.
MORENO: I'm the one that's going.
GRACE: Okay.

ARLEEN: I am sincerely not up to having my friends involved with such things.
SANDRA: Well sincerely, she knows where I come from.
ARLEEN: Mami, it's not about where you come from or who you are or what you did in the past. I want
you to understand that supposedly the sucker is
me for not serving the Lord.
SANDRA claims she cannot deal with the frustration that she feels.
SANDRA: I am a woman who knows her place and when I give my word, I will die over it. I did eight
fucking years in jail having been able to say who it was and I did it because I know that I am a real thug

called it will be your problem and I do not
want to know about anything else.
SANDRA: That they arrest me, that does not bother me because I know how to do time.
ARLEEN: Okay Mami, do whatever it is that you want to do.
SANDRA: So that she does not take me as a fool and learn to respect. If I get her today, I will chop her in
pieces for meat pies.
ARLEEN: Mami, do whatever you want to do. I really can't tell you anything else.
SANDRA: No, you can't tell me anything else because I will go back over there... because if I get to go I
will kill her. It's not that I would hit her, I will kill her.

BERNAL: Yes...and to me they..
VALDEZ: With everything?
BERNAL: With everything!
VALDEZ: But how did that happen?
BERNAL: Oh, well remember when I told you that we came down from there (Poss.Yonkers), I
told him to take it to his house.
VALDEZ: Mmm...hmm.
BERNAL: Then, but it looks like they were following us from here...to up there (Yonkers)...so
then I told him 'put it away', so I don't know if they were watching him, because...
VALDEZ: Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait, I don't understanding, I don't understand, [sighs deep]
BERNAL: We went up there (Yonkers) right? Remember that I tild you they were following us
(BERNAL& MANNY).
VALDEZ: Where up there did you guys go, to my house?
BERNAL: Uh-huh.
VALDEZ: Damn, and when you walked out from my house they (Law enforcement) were there?
BERNAL: No, no, I don't know, I don't know if...I think they followed us.
VALDEZ: Wow, so then that was close to the house?
BERNAL: Listen listen, then I am thinking that they started following us from here, because
listen to what happened, on the way over there (Yonkers) I was remembering that it wasn't the same one
(Mailman) that handed it over it was another guy.
VALDEZ: It was another guy, from the Post Office?
een
BERNAL: Uh-huh.
VALDEZ: And you guys went to the house, and they followed you all the way up?
BERNAL: It seems like that
VALDEZ: Ay, ay, ay, what a problem.
BERNAL: Then they took me...they took him, then I was here on the line (cab service line), and
they took me to the precinct, they asked me questions, they held me there, but then they let me go, so I
don't doubt that they probably went up there (Yonkers home).
VALDEZ: That they went up to my house?
BERNAL: Uh-huh.
VALDEZ: Ay, ay ay, and you guys went upstairs with the box, did you go inside the parking?
BERNAL: No I parked outside.
VALDEZ: Phew! Did they go upstairs into the building, or no?
BERNAL: Yes.
VALDEZ: The cops?
BERNAL: No I don't know, if they went up, because it didn't happen over there it was over here,
they let us come back over here.
VALDEZ: And you guys came out with he box in your hands, and you took it inside?
BERNAL: Yes.
VALDEZ: Wow they followed you that's dangerous.
BERNAL: Yes.
VALDEZ: Huh, dangerous, dangerous.
BERNAL: Well then...
VALDEZ: When...huh?
BERNAL: No, that the fun is over, it's way to close
VALDEZ: Yeah too close. What did they ask you?

BERNAL: That who did that belong to, I said I don't know, you know because I'm the cab driver,
you understand, he's my friend.
VALDEZ: Did they ask you anything about Yonkers?
BERNAL: That who lived there?
VALDEZ: What did you tell them?
BERNAL: I said a friend of mine.
VALDEZ: Did you give them the floor?
BERNAL: They have to...I didn't tell them the floor, but, but, I don't know if maybe they went to
the super or MANNY said something, I don't know, I'm not sure...because they even took the car.
VALDEZ: What car?
BERNAL: Mine.
VALDEZ: They have it?
BERNAL: No I have it, I'm working, but that when they took me, they took me in another car to
the precinct.
VALDEZ: Okay.
BERNAL: So then they took my car.
VALDEZ: Damn, so then I wont be able to go to the house.
BERNAL: And they looked in it (Car)...no because there's nothing there.
VALDEZ: Huh?
BERNAL: There's nothing there...there's nothing there...so...
VALDEZ: Wow now your scaring me because if they asked you...
BERNAL: Listen, I think that your keys were here in the car.
VALDEZ: And they aren't now?
BERNAL: No they're here, I have them, I'm just saying, maybe they went to check.
VALDEZ: They went in your car?
een
BERNAL: What?
VALDEZ: Did they go in your car?
BERNAL: No, no, no, they took me to the precinct, and they took the car.
VALDEZ: Yes but if the keys are there, they didn't touch them, because then they would've told you 'tak
us to this apartment'
BERNAL: I don't know because, remember I haven't seen MANNY, maybe MANNY said
something, I don't know.
VALDEZ: Ay, ay, ay, now I;m really scared.
BERNAL: Now you know.
VALDEZ: Take my keys out of there (Bernal's cab).
BERNAL: What?
VALDEZ: When they they take MANNY they went to his house?
BERNAL: Yesterday in the afternoon, after you and I spoke, because he was wait [Background

VALDEZ: He was going to pass it, the morning?
BERNAL: What?
VALDEZ: It was in the morning that they got him?
BERNAL: No, no, it was yesterday in the afternoon. But I didn't dare call anyone, I just thought to
myself I'll call tomorrow...I went home after I left from there, I was nervous and everything.
VALDEZ: That was last night that they got him?
BERNAL: What was that?
VALDEZ: They got him yesterday
BERNAL: Yes...yes.
VALDEZ: So they took him to the house, and it was another person (Postman)?
BERNAL: It was another guy yes. That's why I'm assuming...that they followed us, because it
looks like they wanted to see where we would take it, you understand me? That's what I'm saying, I don't

know, that's why they hit s.
VALDEZ: So then they thought, well if they (Bernal& Manny) went all the way over there', they
thought...then they got him with that outside in the house?
BERNAL: Coming down, because I called him, 'lets go, and take...bring that so I can hand that
over, and get rid of it' because I held on to it.
VALDEZ: Right.
BERNAL: After I told you about the SUV, I told him go and put it away at the house (Manny's house).
VALDEZ: Ay, ay ay
BERNAL: Then...now you know.
VALDEZ: Ay, ay, ay..damn, and that's Federal?
BERNAL: No it was...
VALDEZ: State?
BERNAL: It was the regular Police.
VALDEZ: That's strange then, because if it was regular police then it was something else.

ARLEEN: Uh-huh.
BERNAL: I do not want to take that risk. Where is MORE a/k/a VALDEZ.

BERNAL: Tell him not to call my telephones.
ARLEEN: Okay.
BERNAL: We have to take care of ourselves because we do not know what these people have been told

ARLEEN: We don't know what is going on.
BERNAL: I am calling you from an agency [Phone Bank].
ARLEEN: Do you want me to make a three-way between you and him so you can talk?

ARLEEN: My love do not hang up, I have 9-8 on the line. Go ahead.
BERNAL: Hello.
VALDEZ: Hello.
BERNAL: What is going on?
VALDEZ: Everything is fine. I am over here dropping off the deposition for the case.
BERNAL: I did not want to call you from my telephones. I am calling you from an agency [Referring to a
phone bank] because we do now know what MANNY has told them. That they don't do... they don't put...
the hooks [Phonetically] ...
[Voices Overlap]
VALDEZ: I was going to tell you to take it easy because... I... when they... they keep those cars.They
would have kept the cars if they would have been interested in them. You understand? They keep the cars
in order to searched them thoroughly. You understand? They check the transmission, they look to see
who was the last owner. Everything.
BERNAL: I called you to the other phone.
[Voices Overlap]
VALDEZ: Yes I know.
BERNAL: Here at 138th and Brown Place [Bronx, NY]. I called you from here.
[Voices Overlap]
VALDEZ: [Unintelligible].
BERNAL: This is what we are going to do when you get here. You are going to call me to the base
[dispatcher] and say; 'Ask 9-8 when can he come pick-up...' Lets say Bronco.
VALDEZ: What should I say?
BERNAL: You tell him, 'Bronco at 184th.' I will know more or less.
VALDEZ: Okay. Do not hang-up 9-8. [Pause] All right. You know what leave the car keys for me at Fior's
We will meet there. That's what I will do. I will call the base [dispatcher].

BERNAL: I know that 184th means over at Fior's.
VALDEZ: Yes, okay.
BERNAL: You understand? Because like that... We protect one another.
VALDEZ: It is best to do it like that.
BERNAL: Listen! This girl...
[Voices overlap]
VALDEZ: Have you found out anything about him?
BERNAL: I haven't found out anything because I am not going to ask. The problem is that I do not know
too many people there and I do not want to go around asking anyone anything. I am waiting for the word to
be spread around, and see if I hear anything.
VALDEZ: So you haven't heard anything. Have you seen his wife?
BERNAL: I haven't seen her either, but we do not know what is going on. If he said something... or
whatever.
VALDEZ: Uh-huh. Are you at the taxi stand?
BERNAL: No I am calling you from an agency [phone bank].
VALDEZ: No I am asking you if you are working.
BERNAL: Yes of course I am working. I have to work.
VALDEZ: Have you noticed any [strange] movements on the line [taxi stand]?
BERNAL: No, no, no, nothing. Everything is quiet. Listen this woman... so and so [Marlene] landlady... I
don't know why I gave her my phone number...
VALDEZ: I have the money. I will take care of the landlady when I get there tomorrow. What was I going
tell you? I am fine here. I will not call you then. I will call the base [dispatcher] tomorrow.
BERNAL: Uh-huh.
VALDEZ: Because I need to fill out the insurance paper, because they already called me regarding to
what was stolen from the house [Referring to the breaking and entering in his apartment in September].
BERNAL: We will talk tomorrow.
