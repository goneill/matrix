[unintelligible] listen cuz...
[Voices Overlap]

anybody in your house?' Are you stupid bro. Do you think Kush [Phonetic] would talk like that
bro.

UM1574:There we go. That's what I'm talking... You see cause... listen it's fine. You guys can
talk shit about Bara's [Phonetic] girl, I don't give a fuck, fuck her my nigga. Fuck his wife.
[Voices Overlap]
PUPI: You really think I would talk shit about him cuz?
UM1574:That's what I'm saying. I didn't believe him my nigga. I said, straight up, 'It's hard to
believe Pupi said something like that.' I told him, 'I had nothing to do with it. Why would he even
want to say something like that.'
PUPI: But the one that I was bugging out, right? Val [Phonetic] was the first nigga
I called. He helled me down. No doubt about it, [unintelligible] I'll be down. I was buggin out. He
held me down. The next day, nigga texting me, 'Yo Pup, after everything I did for you yesterday
bro? For real bro? You gonna tell Zarina that she'll never leave me cause she loves me too
much. Even if I did say that. I swear to Allah, I have no memory of this shit. But even if I did say
that, what is so bad about that bro?

what? I'm done.
UM1574:What?
PUPI: I'm leaving in 2 hours. Your brother ain't gonna get touched.
UM1574:Where you going?
PUPI: Your brother ain't gonna get touched but the next nigga, no promises. Keep
your part for the next nigga. You know what I'm talking about.
UM1574:I know, listen cuz. Can I talk? Listen Pup. Yo.
PUPI: What?
UM1574:Bara told me when you were talking to him on the phone. Pupi said, 'Fuck you, fuck
your wife and fuck your nephew.' Who is his nephew? That's my son. You know what I'm saying?
[Voices Overlap]
PUPI: Cuz, I got nothing to lie about. But I said, 'This shit came to the point, he's
pressing me, saying, 'Yo, you and your brothers are gonna die.' That's what he's telling me bro.
You know what i'm saying? Bara [Phonetic] is texting me, 'You and your brothers are gonna
die.' That's what he's telling me bro.
UM1574:Okay.
PUPI: Bara is texting me, 'You and your brothers are gonna die.' Cause we
popped on Loco [Phonetic] and 20 other Arab niggas that wanted to fight me. 20 Arab niggas
wanted to fight me. I was there dolo (alone). You feel me?
UM1574:Yeah.
PUPI: Obviously I'm gonna call my brother.
[Voices Overlap]
UM1574:I'm not mad at you over there. I don't care for that cuz. I care about what...
[Voices Overlap]
PUPI: Can you listen?
UM1574:Yeah.
PUPI: About 20 nigga in the living room bro. I walk up to these nigga and say,
'What's up bro? Remember me I'm Loco's bro.' How he talking about, 'Little man.' I'm like,
'Yeah bro. I guess if that's what you call him, Little man.' They were like, 'Bro, take a walk.'
'Nigga, what is [unintelligible] A-B-I [Phonetic] all day. You know this nigga A.B.I. that nigga A.B.I
[Phonetic] ?' I said, 'Nah. Your mans must be FU [Phonetic] cause he ain't A.B.I. [Phonetic] '
So this nigga started pressing me, right? That nigga is smaller than me, cuz. So behind my
neck, I have 20 other Arab niggas hounding over me, you know what I'm saying? 'No problem
brother, you got it.' You know once Pupi says that, that's not what it is.
UM1574:Yeah, obviously.
PUPI: 'Yo, you got it son.' I text Loc, 'Yo, Loc.I'm gonna pop on your mans.' 'Nah
bro. Yo, bro, you buggin out. Throwing rocks at my niggas this and that.' I said, 'Say no more.
You ride for your niggas?' Once you he said, 'I ride for my niggas.' I called Kush [Phonetic], 'Yo
Kush, pull up.' Fell me?
UM1574:Okay.
PUPI: Alright, so we leave living room I pop it off, I wanted to know... The only
nigga running after me is Loco, so Kush pops on him. Nigga Loc, didn't do nothing. I swear to
you bro. I swear on all 4 of my nephews plus your nephew, plus your son is my nephew. You feel
me? All 5 of my nephews drop dead right now nigga Loc stood there like a bitch nigga after he
got hit.
UM1574:Dead ass, they didn't do nothing?
PUPI: They didn't do nothing nigga. I cropped his boy, Kush cropped him and he
didn't do nothing nigga. There were 20 Arab niggas. It's me, Kush and 1 other Albanian nigga
and the 4th Albanian nigga that was there was Marco [Phonetic]. Marco my nigga.
[Voices Overlap]
UM1574:Yeah, Marco ain't do nothing. Yeah, I know.
[Voices Overlap]
PUPI: Marco is like, 'Pup, please stop.' You feel me? So Bara texting me, 'You
want to jump Loco with your brothers, bro. That's how you feel bro? Yeah, bro. Say no more
nigga, you and your brothers just signed a death certificate.' I'll send you the comment right now.
(Refer to Product ID # 30311926 on Coolminor.) I'll send you the comment right now on the
phone. Nigga said, 'Yo Pup, first of all, half of Brooklyn fucked your ex.'
UM1574:What's that?
PUPI: I didn't even hold that against him because I don't give a fuck about my ex.
[Laughs]
UM1574:Nah, fuck that. That's irrelevant nigga. Nobody care about that bitch.
[Voices Overlap]
PUPI: That's how deep he was. I just sent you the comment. I said, 'Yo Bara,
[Stammers] When you come right now, I swear on all 4 of my nephews, I swear on your nephew,
that it's just gonna be me and you.' 'Yo bro, you serious bro? You swearing on my nephew?'
That's when he got the whole nephew scene from.

me and Kush, come on my nigga. And none of the bouncers on none of the Arab niggas. I swear
to Allah, it's war on my nigga. If that was me, you, Bara, Mamhoud [Phonetic] and say Alfred

UM3752: I just taking my mom to the hospital right now. I just got home from Long
Island.
PUPI: Why, what happened?
UM3752: Uh, she has like a hearing issue. She got into a car accident back in 2001.
But now there is like some blockage she can't hear anything at all.
PUPI: I got the same thing in my right ear but the doctor said... I can't hear nothing.
[Stammers] I just hear noise.
[Voices Overlap]
UM3752: Yeah.
PUPI: When somebody calls me I pick it up with my left ear.
UM3752: Hmm.
PUPI: The doctor told me it had something to do with my throat and my noise,
because your throat, your nose and your ears are all connected.
UM3752: Yeah, they are. All of them are connected.
PUPI: Inshalla it is nothing
UM3752: Yeah, I mean I hope not. I hope they fix the issue. I think it's just a bit of wax
or something that they gotta take out. My mom is in pain bro, she's been telling me for a week
and I can't bear to see her like that.
PUPI: That's my worse pains right there bro.
UM3752: My boy is working at the hospital right now, my cousin.

PUPI: Especially at this time of the night too.
UM3752: Yeah, definitely, right?
PUPI: Yeah. You should be right in and out, it's a fast process over there.
UM3752: I tried calling this nigga a few days. I've been calling him for 3 days now. He
don't pick up my phone call. He texted me back, 'He's like, I'll call you later.' He don't pick up.
PUPI: I'm not thinking about that.
UM3752: Just think about your family. You're gone visit your family? Your parents are
there too?
PUPI: No, my parents just came back 2 days ago.
UM3752: Yeah you told me they were coming back, that's why... You should have
been there together.
PUPI: Nah, I'll have the whole crib to myself. My brother is coming now but then
he's coming back in 2 weeks.
UM3752: Nice. Don't do nothing stupid, please.
PUPI: Ah, damn. Why is everybody saying that?
UM3752: Because I know you.
PUPI: Why, What can I do over there?
UM3752: Yeah, 'Cause You're like in a state of depression right now, you can do
anything stupid.
PUPI: [Laughs]
UM3752: You know what I am saying nigga. Just call me whenever you get there, you
land and shit.
PUPI: I can Facetime you all day. I have 4G all over the world.
