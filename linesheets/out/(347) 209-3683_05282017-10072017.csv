like ""Yo! What was that all that about? "" Like... You know what I mean? They're like ""Yo. We

KERRY I just feel like I should tell you. I met up with Crissy and... Linda and Crissy, you know
what I'm talking about?
MIN: Yeah.
KERRY: A'ight. I met up with her or whatever, because uh... she was having problems selling
her script [prescription] or whatever, because nobody wants to talk with him no more. But, I told
her I would take it, she gave me a decent number and this is the first time I've seen her since.
And uh... make a long story short, as she was talking to me, and I was asking her questions...
MIN: Huh?
KERRY: I was asking her questions and shit, and they say said that they were questioning her

you know what I mean? It is what it is, my nigga.
KERRY: No, no, a hundred percent, but that's not the part that scared me for you. The reason
I'm calling you is she told me that they have you under investigation for three deaths.
MIN: For three deaths?
KERRY: Yeah, like two OD's, people that die.
MIN: Come on, my migga she's not, she's talking out of her ass, bro. I've never

Barras [Phonetic] serving her all that Fentanyl, my nigga... all that dumb shit. She needs to worry
about that, I have nothing to do with anything or whatever she's talking about. So, I have no clue
what the fuck she's talking about.
KERRY: I know, I know.
MIN: Tell her to keep her mouth shut, my nigga. I don't even wanna... When I see
that bitch, I'mma tell her to keep my dick out her mouth, stop talking about me.
KERRY: For real....
MIN: Don't even talk to her about me, bro. Do me a favor, don't talk about me to
anybody, bro.
KERRY: No, I know. She men-... she mentioned it to me.
MIN: Yeah, but don't even ask her, my nigga. You went to... you talked to this
bitch without telling me nothing. You gotta tell me. I always tell you, don't be bringing up to this
bitch up, my nigga. You don't know if she's tapped, my nigga, or if she's wearing a wire. You
have no clue, bro.

MIN: You should know that, my nigga. Don't do that next time, bro, for real.
KERRY: No, that's what I'm telling you, my nigga, She didn't bring you... I didn't bring you up,
she did. You know what I'm saying. I just asked her... I was like, ""Yo, why you...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: You should stop her. Yo why... I have nothing to do with tha and that's it, my

MIN: You know what I mean? Like, she... bro, she stays in jail time, my nigga.
They'll do anything for them not to go to jail, my nigga. They'll suck the next nigga's dick that day
for them to stay out of jail
KERRY: Nah, you're right. They're not...

KERRY: Yeah, how the fuck...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: She brought... Why she ain't bring up all the fucking... thousand people that
did that... You know what I mean? She brought up only people she fucked with before. You
know what I mean? Like, that's it, why... Oh, this nigga's investigation, this and that. And they
are not going to tell her, yo, he's investigation. But they're not going tell her leave...
[Voices Overlap]
KERRY: No, no.
MIN: They're not going to tell her, ""Yo, these three people OD (overdosed), so
we're investigating him."" You know what I mean? They are not telling her that shit, my nigga. So
she can run back and tell me, no they're not.
KERRY: Yeah, you're right, you're right. I'm just saying...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: I'm just trying to help you, [Aside: She's out running around in the street
babe. She's out! What do you mean? She just told Kerr, I don't know. I don't talk to her. I stay
away from her. I don't have her number.] They're not gonna do that, my nigga. You know what I
mean? That's like fucking... if you... If I get caught and you're my man, right, I just run back, ""Oh

If you did business with me in the pass or anything, they are not telling you none of that shit.
KERRY: Yeah nah, you're right. You're right...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: They're not doing that, she's fucking talking out her ass. Yo man, let me tell
you something about ""Fiends"", bro, real shit. Fiends will do anything to be on your buddy,
buddy side, be realistic, my nigga. They'll do whatever. You know how many stories I heard
about nigga said that, ""Yo, I got arrested, and, and..."" And the boys... the boys were like uh... the
boys were like um... yo, they're looking out for you, watching out for you, 'cause if you don't got
don't got no money, nigga they wanna call me, that's why. ""You know what, you help me out with
a fucking tip, you're the neighbor watch. Let me give you fucking something for being a
neighborhood watch."" That's what they do, my nigga.
KERRY: Yeah, you're right, I agreed with you.
MIN: They gonna do that, bro. And they're gonna do that to you. If they want to
just grab something of you. They're gonna say what they fuck they can when is .... 'cause she's
hurting, my nigga. Who's fucking with her, be realistic. Nobody. You had to fucking take
something from her.
KERRY: Yeah. The only reason I'm doing that, it's 'cause she called me up, she gave me a
retarded number. She called me...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Yo, but stop doing that, my nigga, she's gonna get you, bro. Stop doing
that, I'm telling you.
KERRY: You think I shoul.. You think I should just not even get it?
MIN: Don't do it, my nigga. Yo, if she's trying to be buddy, buddy with you... You
know what I mean? I'm gonna tell her something. Don't say nothing until I'm in the safe side, my
nigga. Obviously not, 'cause you told me. You know what I mean? I'm gonna say, ""Yo, keep my
name out of your mouth, I have nothing to do wih you...""
[Voices Overlap]
KERRY: Yo. Yo honestly, if you want to fucking say something to her, it's on you, go right
ahead, I don't give a fuck about it.
MIN: Yeah, Nigga, I'mma be, ""Yo, you're talking to somebody that knows me,
that's going to hit me up and tell me."" You know what I mean?
KERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, I do....
MIN: She don't give a fuck, she's so busted, nigga.
KERRY: I didn't like when she said that and I just walked away...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: [Aside: Baby, she's fucking lying.] You said what?
KERRY: I just walked away from that bitch after she got in the house. A'ight. A'ight, bye. She
looked like she just smoked crack, too. So, I wasn't gonna...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: She's a crack head, my nigga. Yo, let me tell you, I'm not taking any fucking
advice about the streets from a fucking crack head. Well, you still can technically, you really
could, honestly. They've been on the streets all their lives. But about information, bro, 'cause
they want to involve me. You know how many times I had niggas tell me, I swear to God this is
ain't the first story. So I thought I was gonna be nervous. First customer told me, I was fucking
nervous as fuck. I've never, my nigga, gave anybody anything that they OD'd ever, ever! Ever in
my life! Ever, bro. Ever. Yo, three deaths, my nigga, I wouldn't be hustling, bro... even at the first
one. You know what I mean?
KERRY: I know, I just felt the need to tell you. She told me that, and I said let me call my nigga
and give him the heads up, you know.
MIN: Yeah, nah, good looking. I appreciate it. But yo, anybody trying to bring me
up to you, my nigga, yo, there is nothing to talk about. Facts. Facts. You already know.
KERRY: That's it. Talk to him about it.
MIN: Next time he tells you, tell him why don't you call him yourself. You know
what I mean? Like, I'll call him right now. You should've called me right on the spot.
KERRY: Yeah, you're right. I just wanted to...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: You should've called me on the spot and I would've been like... Yo... I
wouldn't have been mad at you, my nigga. I would've like, Yo... I would've told her, ""Yo, do me a
favor, keep my dick out your mouth."" I would've said that. ""I don't talk about you, I don't care.""
KERRY: Yeah, you know what it is? I just wanted to get the fuck away from her, this bitch looks
banged. You know what I'm saying? I didn't want to...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Yeah, but she smokes crack, though. She's a known... one of the biggest
known crack head in New Dorp, dawg. For real, for real.
KERRY: For real, for real.

JOHN and MIN greet
MIN: What happened?
JOHN: [Stutters] I picked Ava up. Because I haven't used the... I still haven't used it. She had
one of her bags in the backseat. One of her Mickey bags. So, I went to go get it.. And the
whole fucking thing is a wreck. I'm like ""What the fuck?"" Everything is all ripped out from the
fucking glove box and from the fucking console. So, I was like ""What the fuck is going on?"" So, I
opened the trunk. There's nothing in the trunk. My fucking computer.... you know. The scanner.
MIN: Mm-hmm.
JOHN: My scanner is gone. And all the tools.
MIN: And what happened to your neighbor now?
JOHN: I don't know. He said they went through his car too. We both... They fucking
ransacked through his car too.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: They stole shit outta your neighbor's car too?
JOHN: Yup. Everything outta the trunk. He said he had a brand new jack back there. Not the
dick neighbor. The guy on the other side. Like... the Hindu guy.
MIN: Oh. They were cool? They didn't say nothing bad?
JOHN: What?
MIN: They don't say nothing bad? Like ""Oh. 'Cause people came there before""
?
JOHN: No. No. No. He's fucking just waiting for the cops. I'm fucking fuming. The fucking
thing is 120 bucks. My computer.
MIN: Did Cucc [Stutters] When Cucc came did he bring anybody back there?
JOHN: Who?
MIN: Cucc.
JOHN: No. Any time he came he just came late.
MIN: You know Cucc knows about that spot. Right? He tells.... He has a big
mouth. He tells alot of people too. I'm being so real with you. 'Cause he always tells me. ""Oh.
Cuz tells me to leave shit in the Passat."" Dah, dah, dah. I'm being real with you. You know what
I mean?
JOHN: Yeah. Well, when Amina was home. You know what I mean? If I'm hanging out with
Amina I couldn't run outside. So, I'd just told him to tell him ""Leave it in the car. Leave it in the
Passat.""
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: I know. But, he has a big ass mouth. I don't know if he's all junkied out. I
don't know what's going on with him.
JOHN: Maybe he's being spiteful. Or being a dick. 'Cause he... you cut him off. I didn't even
think of him. I didn't even think of him. I'm gonna tell 'em to dust the car for prints.
MIN: Yeah. But, my fingerprints are on that car too. You know that. Right?
JOHN: What?
MINA; My fingerprints are on it from the other night. Remember I told you I tried checking the
doors and it wasn't open?
JOHN: Right. Right.
MIN: You know what I mean? So...
JOHN: No. I'm gonna have 'em do inside the car.
MIN: Oh yeah. 'Cause everybody touches outside. Yeah.
JOHN: Outside... a million people touch the car.
MIN: You're right. You're right. You're right. Yeah. No. Yeah. Your doors are all
locked.
[Voices Overlap]
JOHN: I just.... Your my cousin. I just took you for a ride. No one else has been inside the car
though. The last prints inside the car has gotta be the fucking ... who fucking went through it.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: You gotta lie and say you had alot of expensive shit in the back. You gotta
say ""Yo. I had mad fucking stuff in there, bro. There's alot of shit missing, bro. I wan't
somebody's fingerprints. I really want 'em to go to fucking jail!""
[Voices Overlap]
JOHN says the only thing he can do is put a claim in to his homeowner's insurance
MIN tells JOHN to do that. JOHN says Amina's Aunt is the insurance rep so she can just put it
through.
JOHN: Thank God I took my wallet out. 'Cause I haven't been using the car. So, I took my
wallet out. And my brother had the Tiguan. [Phonetic]
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: [Aside: Where your phone at? Oh. Up there.]
JOHN says Amina is in Atlantic City.
[MIN continues to talk aside with his gir]
MIN: Yeah. But, the only thing is Cucc. That nigga chills with all junkies.
JOHN: I didn't even think of him.
MIN: All he does is get high with all those junkies That's why I don't fuck with that
nigga no more. He's a faggot.
JOHN: Yeah. But, I would always see him come in.
He knows that.
MIN: Yeah. But, why would he go...out of all cars... in your car?
JOHN: Well, it's the guy next door too., It wasn't just me.
I mean... But , the cars are right next to each other.
MIN: That's what I'm saying. Think about it. No? Why would he go to those two
cars. He didn't try no other car around there?
JOHN says the rest of the neighbors use their garages.
JOHN: The guy on the end. The black guy. He's a cop. He works late at night. I don't know.
I'm waiting for the cops to come. I don't know. See what they tell me. I gotta fill out a report.
JOHN goes on to say he was out there cursing and screaming and the neighbor asked if they
stole stuff from JOHN's car too. The neighbor said he noticed they robbed stuff outta the cars
this morning.
JOHN says he's glad he took his wallet out of the car and they weren't able to steal his identity.
JOHN says Amina is in AC. Amina won 2800 dollars on slots.
MIN and JOHN talk about John's daughter getting big now.
MIN: So, yo. You didn't find those fucking three? .
JOHN: No. I didn't find nothing. I'm wondering if the same fucking asshole that took them
came back and still robbed the cars. But, I don't know. But, that makes more sense now. Cucc.
Now I'm fucking bugging about him. You think he's following me around?
MIN : I don't know, bro. I look around me alot lately.
JOHN: Yeah? I know you're usually careful. Let me call you after the cops get here.
MIN: A'ight, bro .
JOHN: See what they say.
MIN: A'ight

my nigga. Don't think because we're friends. When it comes to my money I will stab you, nigga.""
KERRY says he feels like smacking Cucc lately too.

KERRY: I don't even know why he is picking you up.
MIN: I need. You know what I mean? He know I need to go somewhere. He has

about.
KERRY: Yeah, I don't know maybe he doesn't feel comfortable.
MIN: I'mma call him, ""Yo, whats up. Why you got to pick up Kerry, nigga. Come
by yourself. I'm not going to violate, slap you or some shit.""
KERRY tells MIN to not call him. He [K] doesn't want MIN to tell him [Cucc] that he told him
about Cucc picking him up. KERRY mentions to MIN that he just did that out of respect.
KERRY: He's calling me right now. I think he is here, right now.

MIN: This kid Anthony, he messes up big time.
UF7569: Why?
MIN: He testified. They put him on the stand... he testified and he said that he
shot her by accident.
UF7569: He shot her by accident?
MIN: Yeah, before he was saying he never did it, when they went to court, when
they went to trial, in the beginning, they were saying, ""He never did it."" The lawyer was like,
""How did he shoot you from this and this and..."" You know he never did it.
UF7569: Okay.
MIN: Now he went on stand, and he said he did it by accident. The fucking
accident.
UF7569: By accident , How by accident, and now?
MIN: Yeah. No, he tried to kill himself first and Brianna stopped him. The real
story is; he tried to kill himself first. He tried to shoot himself in the head. That really happened,
she tried to stop him and he shot her. He's trying to say it's by accident.
UF7569: He was faking as if he wanted to shoot himself because he was not going to kill
himself
MIN: He's done now. He's going to get proven guilty.
UF7569: What have they punish him?
MIN: No they are not punishing but it is up to the jury
UF7569: Where are you now?
MIN: On my way to Staten Island.
UF7569: You finish work?

was like ""Yo! Why don't you never hit me up, my nigga? I got that! That's why I haven't been
calling you. I been grabbing like bud and weed and shit. "" I said ""But, I don't keep my shit out
here. I bring it."" He's like "" I got you."" He's like ""Yo. Grab some for me and show me. Grab
me a few samples."" I said ""Yo. My mans get different flavors though. "" And I was like I'm
being... I told him the prices. I was mad... Yo. I was realistic with him. I was like ""Yo. My nigga.
On some real shit."" I'm like "" I get mad... all indoors, bro. Like all fire indoors. You know what I
mean? "" Like the price varies. I was like ""They go high."" But, he understood me. He actually
understood. He didn't complain. He goes "" Yo, my nigga. If it's 26 and it's fire I'll take it, bro."" I
said ""Sometimes there 27 or 28."" He goes "" Yo. If it's legit. If it's worth it. I'll take it."" He

Pupi leaves the car there, then he goes to work. I told; like I didn't tell Pupi about it. I said ""the

whatever he has. MIN tells UM that he has to pay his lawyer with that money because he has

JASMIN calls dad and says he doesn't know what dad is doing every weekend in Yonkers
doing no job and bringing no money home. JASMIN asks dad to give to him job over the
weekend because he wants to make some money.
Most of the call is overlapping and arguing. JASMIN says to dad you want to know about me and
I want to know about you.
DAD says that I don't need to report my son and JASMIN calls dad a liar that is hiding everything
from mom.
JASMIN says that he gets everything and he knows everything that goes around.
JASMIN says to dad that he can not lie anymore.

JASMIN: I am calling because I am owe some money for the storage.
UF4507 asks JASMIN for the unit number but JASMIN says he does not know it because his
father is the one that put all the stuff( Jasmin's) into the unit.
JASMIN gives UN4507 the name of his father Skender CEJOVIC.
UF4507: The balance is 668
JASMIN: 668 , why is that?
UF4507: It is two months rent and the late fees. And the stuff is due for auction on October 3rd.
JASMIN: There is a miscommunication. I was away and he told me he paid. [Unintelligible]. And
it is all my stuff in there. None a single thing is his. Everything in there is my. And he moved my
stuff. I was away for a few months. And I don't have any control on this. It is all my stuff in there.
And I don't have all the money to pay right now, the 668.
UF4507: 668 has to be paid at least before September 14.
JASMIN and UF4507 talk about payment options for the remaining amount.

MIN tells UM6884 to try not to send him the tickets that he is selling on Vivid by mistake or else
he won't be able to go to the concert.
UM6884 tells MIn to print all 4 tickets out -- and he will tell him which seats.
MIN tells Um6884 that he might have someone take the tickets -- $200 each.

UM9394:I think so. Nigga, when we was in the crib bro, Mark was there. He didn't do anything.
He swallowed spit, trembling bro and playing 2k my nigga. I even got into multiple arguments
with him about this. He just kept giving me the days and said themselves if we would have
intervened or got involved, it wouldn't help and there was nothing... it wouldn't have changed the
outcome. It wouldn't change anything. And then he still going back there too and when I press

what I mean? Maybe I'm bogging. Maybe no mother fuckers are after me, I don't know, you know
what I mean?
MARK: Yeah.
MIN: So I go on the crib. Dumb. So, I go back outside on the front. My pops had
to drop me off home because I have the dog with me. They said, ""I will take you home,""
whatever. I got you, you got your dog with you."" So that's what I'm doing. I'm in the front of the
crib, I'm waiting, I'm waiting, and my pops come in front of the crib with my husky saying about to
walk him a'right, so I see the car pass by again and pass by again. I'm like, "" this mother fucker
are up to no good, obviously I don't know what's going on. so I'm thinking like alright, I don't think
is gonna happen 'cause my pop is in the front. Maybe some fool is gonna wait that I'm solo, you
know what I mean? whatever. So my pops... some nigga get out of the car, he starts walking to
my crib. I'm looking at him eye to eye I never took my eyes once. So I can get a clear vision of
his face bro. never took my eyes once. Whatever. Then I don't know where he is walking by,
whatever and he is like, he looks at my pops and he says, ""Nice dog"" and my pop is, ""Thanks
buddy, I appreciate it."" You know what I mean? he kept on walking, he jumped on the wit again.
And whatever, in the bounce.
MARK: Hello?
MIN: And I never seen him again, bro. And I called Tack [Phonetic] and I still
haven't called fucking Tack [Phonetic] dumb ass, he didn't tell me what happened. I got excited

MIN: Wait, he was not?
MARK: He was not gonna get robbed bro. He has nothing to do that I'm gonna be honest with
you. You know what I'm saying? This nigga has nothing to do with it. He just [Unintelligible] two
sentences and that's why he got robbed, you know what I'm saying. He ended up right trying like
see him his citizenship before even with, like with Rick, he was in a fight mode [Phonetic] with
his mouth. I don't know he was telling nigga, ""Mind your fucking ...."" Telling nigga this and that,
he wasn't even...

MIN: Yo, he was going on Rick?
MARK: Yeah, because they robbed Rick too. And they were call the boy, call the boy.
MIN: Wait, wait, they knew, they knew... they said, call his boys...
MARK: They were like, ""call your boy, call your boy Rick"" because Rick supposedly, there was
some shit going on were, niggas took Gino's chain. The nigga went over his [Unintelligible] so
that's main reason why everything happened. Tarick [Phonetic] wasn't even there. He come
through with mad gang members, this is the [Unintelligible] telling square, ""yo square,
[Unintelligible] that to me"" so the nigga is looking at this nigga like he is fool already but not
doing anything for this man.
MIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MARK: Then yet, the nigga is talking about the two nigga that could stole the chain. This nigga
Tarick is like, ""Well, I know Rick, and is not really in his caliber, is not really in his character to
rob, so the cleverly pointing out, so putting in risk this nigga. So the nigga started like, ""Yo, shit

night when the nigga was robbed, it was over. This nigga didn't even they weren't gonna nothing.
Then the next morning bro... nigga snaps [Unintelligible] Tarick throat. I don't know I think he

brother like ""yo, we don't got no static with you bro, it was just Terick"", you know what I'm saying?
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Oh they were like ""yo, it's whatever, you're not involved in this.""
MARK: They wanted to tell Tericks little brother like ""yo bro, we don't want no static dogs."" It's
was just that night because Terick was coming out of his face, that happened. Don't think that
we're gonna come and see you and try to rob you. That's not gonna happen."" That's what they
want to tell Tericks brother. Tericks texts niggas saying ""why the fuck niggas calling my bro?!

MIN: Alright, long story short, pretty much fucking..they didn't try following
me....It's probably, probably...it's fucking, it's really 'cause of Tariq that's why they came by crib
really, but they probably thought I was him or some shit. I found out through Mark they don't
know nothing about me, it's really with Tariq. They come look for Tariq 'cause... basically they
got robbed bro. Tariq got robbed, he got robbed because... again he didn't keep his mouth
shut. The second time. They were robbing his boy and now his boy.. whatever, some shit
happened between his boy and them. It was their beef. It has nothing to do with Tariq. It was their
beef... fucking Tariq didn't keep his mouth shut, he's started talking shit, whatever. And they
fucking robbed his ass too. And MARK was there. MARK couldn't do nothing obviously. The
niggas all had guns, all strapped. They robbed fucking Tariq too, and basically when Tarak and
Reek... when they bounced and they got robbed... Tarak was talking mad shit, ""oh we are gonna
fucking... come after your life."" They're like ""Oh, You are threatening my life now? Aight, no
doubt."" So they're talking mad shit. And these are niggas that gotta live like that every day. Like
when somebody tells them ""a guy threaten my life"" that's how good is gonna be. They are gonna
be on guard, they are gonna come after you, before you touch them. That's what they are doing
right now.

JASMIN aka MIN aka MANNY
MIN: [Aside: One second.] Yeah, what's up?
JACKIE: I have the money and the card. Why you even over there?
MIN: I'll tell you after. You didn't let me finish. [Aside: I don't know. I'll be back. I
have to go somewhere. No... What? I don't know I have to check. I'm on the phone.] I have to go
over here. I found what happened yesterday. I spoke to fucking Mark. This nigga Tag [Phonetic]
is a fucking faggot, blaming somebody else. I'm a tell you right now. I came in to talk to my mom
and tell her. My brother called me too. I said, ""Don't stay in front of the house too much. Stay
away in front of the crib right now."" This dumb nigga walked to the house. These niggaas were
strapped. Mark kept it real with me. I spoke to Mark on the phone. ""These nigga is strapped bro.
These niggas all got burned. Every single got burned, they were all strapped. I'll never lie to you
my nigga. They all strapped, all them niggas got gunned."" That nigga that walked by last night?
100% had the burn on him. That's why he was all confident to walk by like that. You know what I
mean?
JACKIE: Yeah.
MIN: Stupid bro. I will tell you what happened. I never told you the shit with Tarry
[Phonetic]. He involved, some big homie, some big blood nigga, he came home from jail. He
was copping sticks with tag. [Stammers] This is mad long ago, when I lived Chris [unintelligible]
apartment. He involved my name in some shit. This nigga. I spoke with him on the phone three
way with them niggas. Tara [Phonetic] banged the phone. The blood nigga called me because
Tara [Phonetic] gave him my number. He said, ""Yo, I robbed Tar, I booked him, you got nothing
to do with this."" I don't even know what's going on. The nigga was telling me this. I was like,
""What you talking about."" I called Tar, Tar is like, ""Yeah, the nigga said this, he'll violate. Tara
[Phonetic] is a bird. He just threw my name in the air. So I can fight and knock niggas out.
Whatever.
JACKIE: Recently or back in the day?
MIN: Before. But my mom knows about this. This is when I beat the shit out of
him and his mom called the cops. Remember when I told you his mom called the cops and I had
to hop the fence and shit.
JACKIE: Yeah?
MIN: The cops ran into my house. My mom had to take the camera wires off
because they wanted to see the cameras where I ran and shit. They didn't know who I was. My
mom had lied. So... pretty much... this time... this dumb nigga... Didn't keep his mouth shit.
Basically when he ran into this kid's crib, the kid's studio, they didn't run into the crib. They are all
chilling there. There was beef with Tarry's [Phonetic] boy, Ric [Phonetic]. I know Ric too
personally. They wanted Ric to come too because they wanted to violate him. It was their beef.
Tarry wasn't involved in it, it was his man's but.. he dug himself in his own hole. You know what I
mean? So pretty much. Tarry was like, ""Nah, fuck out of here. Niggas pull their guns, matter fact,
we pull our shit out too."" They robbed him, Tarry and Ric, they are not gangsters my nigga. I don't
care how much of heart you have to fight. Not a shooter bro. They never go back there. Tarry's
little brother is raps too, he's nice or whatever. They call his brother like, ""Yo, you got nothing to
do with this bro."" They called his brother like, ""Yo, you got nothing to do with this bro."" They
called his brother. ""He ran his mouth, acted all hard, that's why we did that to that nigga. But you,
you good. You got nothing to do with this."" They told his little brother that. Mark told me all of this.
I called Mark today. ""I spoke to Tar [Phonetic] again. Let me call this nigga one more time. "" He
always fucks up his story. So when I asked him, ""Did you talk about me?"" He was like, ""Nah."" I
was like, ""Yo, Mark still chilled over there? You said Mark anything?"" He such a fucking faggot,
he threw Mark right under the bus mad quick. I know Mark would never talk about me. He has no
reason to talk about me. So... whatever... Tar is knows for this. My friend would tell you. He was
like,
Yeah, probably. I don't doubt it. That nigga is chilling there. He was saying all this. I was like,
""Yeah? No problem?"" So... I called Mark, Mark is like, ""Bro. You good?"" I said, ""Be honest with
me, they came by crib yesterday."" He said, ""Alright, i'll tell you everything. I told him, ""Tarry told
me a story and I'll tell you after. I need to hear shit first."" He tells me everything. I knew Tarry's
story was fishy. He told me, ""Honest with you, Tarry has a big fucking mouth. He could have
avoid it. He opened his mouth and saw he got robbed.""
MIN tells JACKIE that TARRY never owes up to anything.
MIN: I asked him, ""Do niggas know about me?"" He said, ""Word to my mother,
niggas not know about you at all."" ""Let me know. That's it."" ""You never got brought up."" I never
chilled with them. I have no reason to get brought up there. I never hang out there. They always
talk about music, always doing Xanax. I don't sell them Xans, nothing. I do nothing with them. Not
any little single thing. I said, ""Honestly, my nigga. I asked Tar, did Mark say anything?' That
nigga said you probably did."" He said, ""My nigga. Are you fucking serious?"" While I'm talking to
Mark, Tarry is texting him. Tarry is texting him, ""Yo, Min is going to call you. Whatever you say,
just keep it short and simple."" To cover his fucking ass. So i'm going to tell Mark to send me the
screenshots.
MIN tells JACKIE that MARK is not a bir and he will send him the screen-shots.
MIN: My mom goes, ""Be here at 8:30 because his mom comes home. I want
them out this fucking house. You are gonna tell his mother."" I was like, ""Whatever I will. For that I
will. If it's for my safty."" I will tell her, ""Your son, is fucking again."" I was telling my moms, ""I don't
even think about this shit no more. Beef, shoot, I don't give a fuck about that."" I told my mom, ""I
was talking to my girl, how to bring my credit up again, to fix shit like that, fix my school loan."" I'm
worried about those kind of stuff right now. Why should I be worried about this?"" Niggas is sad
bro.
MIN tells JACKIE he told MARK to have him speak to him and MARK agreed.
MIN tells JACKIE he hadn't been there since the robbery.
MIN: I asked him about the extortion thing, he goes, ""Honestly, think they are
really extorting, they are walking out the niggas crib like they own the place. Smoking that niggas
weed."" This kid Gino with the studio, they one they robbed, they violate, they are extorting that
nigga. They are making that nigga give them his money. He is the one that I wanted to slap at the
Funky Elephant, when went to eat. I kept on grilling him for no reason. This nigga is pussy. I
wouldn't doubt Gino probably gave Tarry a couple... ""He lives there."" They didn't know where he
lived at.
JACKIE and MIN engage in a social conversation regarding the country MONTENEGRO and
that is where MIN'S family and JACKIE'S friend is from there also.
MIN: I'm waiting for my cousin to pick me up. He's not ready yet. He had to do
something with his father, ""Give me a few. I'm running errands with my dad."" I I should taken that
Benydryl. I should have got up, woke his up and went straight to Brooklyn and did everything
today. Fuck. [brief pause] He has his money in the card?
JACKIE: Yeah, to pay the thing.
MIN: Alright, I'm going to send it to you right now. Go to Drugcap.com.
JACKIE: Why I got to do it?
MIN: Just do it babe, it takes 2 fucking minutes.
JACKIE and MIN argue over who should go into the website DRUGCAP.COM
MIN: Go onto the website and look up my docket number and type in my name. I
don't know my docket number.

MIN tells JACKIE how to check on the website.
MIN complains to JACKIE about his neck pain.
MIN and JACKIE agree on using JACKIE'S debit car on the website.

you some shit. Basically bro, I made a problem... at my cousin's block one day. The nigga
ain't here, I didn't jump on his whip. You know what I mean? Basically, I can't.... It's two month
ago. So... [Aside: Metro not over there, come on, come on.] and then fucking... this was two
months ago. So pretty much they followed the nigga to his crib bro, you know what I mean?

Ain't find nothing. So, he called me and told me, ""Yo! whatever you do, get the fuck out of there,
where ever you at?"" You know what I mean, these niggas followed me to my crib, all that shit.
So, pretty much, uhm... so fucking then, huh.... What the fucked happened? So I went to... I
bounced. So my cousin in the middle of the night, they knocked him out, 'cause they see me
going to his fucking crib.
UM6884:Oh my God.
MIN: Yeah, my nigga. It was like... I just got picked up though, bro... it wasn't
like... you know what I mean? I don't know, I look suspect to them, whatever, my nigga. I made
a stupid move. I got caught up, you know what I mean? So, pretty much... fucking... they
knocked him out, they were like.... ""Yo! I keep people like that out of your house"" They trying to
say, I did some shit. You know what I mean? Whatever. So, pretty much... fucking yesterday...
me and this nigga went to Brooklyn, you know what I mean? I wasn't so crazy but this nigga
went to Brooklyn.
UM6884: Uhmm.
MIN: The same car, one of the cars, nigga... fucking following us bro.

MIN: Nigga was following us....but yo! [Stammers] He... he.. he... I dipped out the
whip. My cousin fucking pull up by the block. I said, ""Leave my here?"" You know what I mean?
I could only get away over here, like you know... I don't know what they are tying to do, you know
what I mean? I don't know who that fuck it is bro. That nigga, is following us. [Stammers] I don't
know where those nigga's are at. If it's someone had beef with, you know? I don't fucking know.
I wasn't thinking like that so, fucking uhmm... the nigga.... pretty much bro, like...whatever,,
[Stammers] he dropped me off here, but his car [Stammers] he was still driving. I opened the
door. I said, ""Okay."" ""Drive as you go."" Because he started making mad turns, you know what I
mean? And the nigga was throwing weren't throwing the siren, it was a GMC, usually he has a
siren on or some shit, like last time he knocked my cousin out, he had siren on, whatever so.
[Aside: Come on Metro, stop playing, come on, come on ] So they fucking follow us.... fucking
Brooklyn off the bridge bro. We ain't go were we had to go, you know, the usual but.... uhh...
but that shit was kind of scary, my nigga, but I feel like it was a Tuesday night. My cousin is mad
and everything.... Yo....""you don't think, these fucking nigga's are watching or something?"" I was
like bro, "" I don't see them watching....and if they seen us do that.... they would had busted
fucking move, my nigga. They would a like, fuck the fucking move. I think... I think is Tuesday.
Barry got locked up yesterday too.
UM6884:Yeah?
MIN: He got locked up, they pull the whip over him , they found two bags of
dope... I don't know... how much..I think it was a few grams. But he got locked up and shit... so

know what I mean? They seen were my cousin be at. They decided to see where the fucking
nigga was going, you know what I mean?
UM6884:No, I think they were probably watching, dude. Considering the story you just gave
me. They were probably watching.

move bro?
UM6884:They probably wanted, [stutters] not just you.. but somebody...the next person.
MIN: Yeah, they seen us together, that's why.
UM6884:You understand. Yeah, they probably.
[Voices overlap]

the convenient. They pulled up in the convenient, whatever. Then uhmmm, I'm like, ""What the
fuck, these nigga's are up to no good whatever."" So, they get out the six, [Unintelligible]. I wish I
had a car opened, to make it work. [Background : Noise] [Unintelligible]
UM6884:Ah-ha.
MIN: So, me and him were making straight eye contact. I'm thinking like, this
nigga is definitely looking for tags or some shit. I'm thinking in my head, maybe is beef with me,
the second he went, augh , augh (clear throat) and shit.
UM6884:Yeah
MIN: So whatever, either one. Nigga walks by... he fucking... my dad outside
with dog now... he goes...""oh that's a nice dog"" and he walks by. His man comes around and
picks him up by the driveway, he picks him up and gets in a whip and uhmm, he just kept on
driving and he bounce. I never seen him again.... I was like, ""what the fuck"". So then, I bang on
the window and I tell my mom, my dad wants to walk the dog. Obviously, [Unintelligible] my
pops there, you know what I mean. I looked down the block, I go inside to see what fucking
happened. I was like, ""you know what?"" I'm gonna fucking tell her, because I don't know what

think is my fault, I did something obviously I went in on them. I called Tariq, he tells me, Oh,

right? Fucking.... he's like yeah....basically let me tell you what Mark said, Gino's chain went
missing...I said, all right. Gino chain went missing... they told to call Riq [Phonetic]. They think
Riq [phonetic] has it..... but I wouldn't doubt it... that Riq.. fuck... stole it.... you know honestly, I
wouldn't doubt Ty [Phonetic] stole it.... for real, you know what I mean.
UM6884: Right.
MIN: I wouldn't fucking doubt it, my nigga, you know what I mean? The nigga can't be
brought out and that's what they do in that circle, you know what I mean?
UM6884: Yeah.
MIN: You know that already bro. I'm not trying to put the blame game on
anybody...and you know what's funny... it could had been anybody [Unintelligible] that did it... and
we fucking blaming Riq [phonetic] all time and Ty, nigga. You know what I mean? They could
had put that shit in their pocket, you know those nigga's are out.
UM6884:100 percent. It could had been them, yeah.

which why they are trying to say Riq stole the chain, whatever....[Aside: Come on Metro, go up
the upstairs]... then whatever, so I'm like, damn.... so then... fucking... Marie [phonetic] came,
no carol, started arguing like.... Rig didn't steal it..he didn't even keep his mouth shut, you know
what I mean... like. Like always, he put his fucking two cents in.. the nigga's weren't saying
nothing, Mark told me, at all, but he kept running his fucking mouth and the nigga's were now you
giving me this shit....Obviously they backed out on him, you know what I mean.
UM6884:Yeah.
MIN: He got rob.... Riq came and robbed him to whatever... Mark was tight... Riq
fucking worked with my bread, you know what I mean?... Like.
UM6884:Yeah.
MIN: So, obviously Mark is like fucking tight....Dan [Phonetic] lost 1400 dollars.
So... It's Riq's fault not Mark's. If it was me, I would tell Riq, he has to come out with the bread.
UM6884:Yeah.
MIN: Obviously... so that's that happened. That happened to Tariq, I told....I kept
it at buck, with fucking Mark. I was like.... Yo, my nigga, obviously...I asked him, if uh.... he goes,
""I haven't chilled there since it happened , so where where you? All right, I don't know when it
happened, I've seen his car there....was it the day, parked or the day before some shit.
Whatever, he said, I haven't been chilling there. So really... I haven't seen them. I haven't seen
them since that happened. I haven't seen them, he was chilling there but he was like, yeah my
nigga, so basically, Ty is fine.
UM6884: You mean, you mean, like for why it happened? Of course, of course.
[Voices overlap]
MIN: He opened... you know what I mean.
UM6884:I was telling, I was telling [Unintelligible] because he know about.... I'm like look,
because he's always taking a [Unintelligible] bro. If it was Pete or I don't know, Frankie
[Unintelligible] telling me the story, it would be much different, I would believe it. Right, you know
what I mean? I can't believe everything Tariq says, I'm not saying his lying, I told him, but I also
heard already a couple of stories of this side of what happened, so...clearly somebody is lying.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: With that bitch. With Donna. [Unintelligible] with Donna... he didn't want to keep his
mouth shut. I heard he was talking mad crazy with the nigga. Like ""come on my ingga, you mad
hot."" He's like ""bro""; and like Mark told me the story. Marks like; my nigga was calm and shit bro.
That nigga looked at me like... trying to violate Tariq. Do you know what I mean? Like.
UM6884:Yeah, he always asks for it. The Indians probably... the Indians are mad good...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Running his fucking mouth. He don't know how to go about it.
UM6884:Even the Arabs bro. I've seen these niggas for 10, 15 years now in the neighborhood.
Never a problem with these kids, you know?
MIN: Hmm.
UM6884:Whoever they are. I don't know them by name, just by face, you know what I mean?
MIN: Yeah.
UM6884:Obviously Tariq has an issue cause he's like they robbed them.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Who?
UM6884:He said the... they're like 28 maybe, 30 years old... Arab niggas, Indian kind of, you
know? Like a little chubby. They're in the neighborhood.
MIN: They robbed Tariq?
UM6884:Yeah, this was like a few months ago, you know what I mean?
MIN: Oh my, yo Stevie was telling me.
[Voices Overlap]
UM6884:Meanwhile they're like normal people, you know what I'm saying? Between you and I,
they're normal people. They're not even involved in shit like this, you know what I'm saying?
MIN: And why they robbed him?
UM6884:I'm sure he mouthed off. Come on bro, let's be real, you know?
MIN: Yeah. Of course.
[Voices Overlap]
UM6884:He doesn't know how to handle it, like you know what I mean?
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Yeah, we're the same way. Somebody starts running their fucking mouth,
[Unintelligible] nigga. Fuck you nigga, your deaded.
UM6884:I mean I did that while you were there. I ain't giving you cent.
MIN: I can't judge, you know what I mean? If I did that and you did that and I was
with you to do that. It's like ""yeah do it bro, I'm down."" You know what I mean?
UM6884:Yeah cause... so even with that, I just feel like... he just says his side of the story. He
doesn't say exactly what happened all the time, you know?
MIN: Yeah, he needs to relax. [Aside: Oh Metro, your leash is on still.] Yeah my
nigga, I don't know bro, because... I don't know bro, this fucking kids a fucking retard. I don't
know bro. Yo these niggas came by my fucking crib bro, like come on man.
UM6884:I know, that's fucking crazy.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: I told my mom. Yo, I [Unintelligible] my mother. I'm like ""yo, I'm not fighting
with this nigga no more. I told her, throw him the fuck out. You have to. I'm sorry, I don't feel bad
no more. I don't. I'm like ""what's next?"" And Mark kept it real. He goes ""that nigga was at Shot
bro, he's probably [Unintelligible] last night."" Them niggas roll to Shots all the time. They beef
with niggas like that. I'm like woah. So if my mom goes out the house and Tariq walks out with
her. They're gonna fucking shoot, they don't give a fuck. These niggas don't care. Tariqs called a
nigga; oh this is what happened, even worst. This is why it escalated, I just remembered. This is
why it escalated, niggas come by the crib. They called Ehab saying like ""yo, you're not involved
in this"", you know what I mean? Trying to tell his younger brother like ""there's no problem with
you. You're brother mouthed off on some shit."" I wouldn't doubt it. They probably think he's a cool
nigga and mad relaxed and chill, like ""yo, his brother is mad humble like... we fuck with the
nigga."" But his older brother is a bird, you know what I mean? Like that niggas a fucking...
[Voices Overlap]
UM6884:Damn, they even reached out like that? That's crazy. That's how you know Tariq is in
the wrong, you know?
MIN: They reached out to Ehab. Why would they call Ehab for? to threaten him
bro? Whatever my nigga... Ehab I know [Unintelligible] dad. He wasn't there so I don't think; why
would they call him? They don't think he's gonna do something to his younger brother, you know
what I mean?
UM6884:Did they call him to press him or did they call and be like ""yo, you're cool.""
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Mark told me they called him to tell him ""yo you're gucci, you're good.""
UM6884:Yeah. He told me they called him to press him.
MIN: I don't know, we should ask Ehab. If I see him, I'ma ask him.
UM6884:Yeah. Gotta ask him himself bro, you know? He'll probably tell the truth.
MIN: I don't know what Tags [Unintelligible] had to say. Oh, Ralph talking to
Mark? This how I know [Unintelligible] blind, cause he's texting Mark... ""yo, Min's gonna call you.
He's gonna ask you about what happened. Whatever you say, just keep it short and simple.""
UM6884:Yeah?
MIN: Mark was like ""yo""; and I'ma tell Mark ""yo, you could send me those screen
shots my nigga?"" I could ask him like what's up? You know? But he was telling me... like ""yo he's
texting me this as I'm talking to you my nigga.""
UM6884:That's crazy.
MIN: So I wouldn't; I'm sure Mark wouldn't make that up.
UM6884:That's how conniving the nigga is bro.
MIN: Because you know what? Niggas don't wanna be involved in that. Do you
know what I mean? They'll keep it a buck. Like ""nigga fuck him! He's fucking lying, I'm over that
shit"", you know what I mean? That nigga ran his mouth, that's it. That's how he made it seem like.
Like my nigga... trust me bro. Niggas don't talk about. He wasn't trying to shit on me but he was
like ""niggas don't even talk bro about you and bring your business up, you know what I mean?
Like it's not like that... you know? So... I don't know bro, it's kind of fishy, fishy.
UM6884:Mad fishy bro. I just left it behind but, yeah I heard a couple of different sides of the
story too. It's made me believe immediately he was lying.
MIN: Tags always adds fuel to the fire bro, do you know what I mean? Like... he
adds fuel like, niggas a re beefing already bro, why would you add fuel to the fire. Call the nigga.
He threatened their life. Like him and Reek called him like ""yo, where gonna kill you."" Them
niggas like yeah? Aight.
UM6884: of course, I know, I know, it's like dude, who are you killing bro? Like you
know what I'm saying?
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Nobody. And he don't got nobody. He goes, ""I'm on deck with the phone for
the nigga from Far Rock you get at that nigga."" I wanna tell him in person, like when I see him...
""why it has to get to that point where I gotta call somebody to... get at these dudes bro? That's
corny bro. Why do you involve yourself with these kind of people my nigga?"" He don't chill with us
no more. I told Pete he's a rapper now, he's a star... he's up with all the famous niggas now, do
you know what I mean?
UM6884:Yeah.
MIN: You know why all this shit's happening to him all the time? His big ass
mouth. He don't know how to be himself and stay humble and quiet. Just be yourself my nigga.
You don't gotta be a loud one to fucking show everybody something. You don't gotta prove
yourself no more cuz, like nobody gives a fuck about that. Niggas rather you be quiet in peace
bro, not bother nobody, not even fight with niggas.
[Voices Overlap]
UM6884:I told him it's very simple. You don't understand how to stay home. ""Go home!"" You
know what I mean? Why you always gotta be somewhere? I was telling him like ""go the fuck
home! Go to [Unintelligible], go home! Go somewhere, you know what I mean? Like niggas get
bored and they just hang out with anybody that they can, like what is wrong with you?
MIN: Yo you see that shit right?
[Voices Overlap]
UM6884:If none of my friends; I've been living like this for years. If none of my close friends that I
could think of off the top of my head are around, I'm staying my ass home.
MIN: Yep.
UM6884:I'm not gonna start calling [Unintelligible] who I'm cool with, or... you know what I mean?
I'm cool with him but I'm not cool with him to hang out... I'ma go home! You know what I mean? I'll
call you, Pete... the Indians... regular people. Niggas ain't around, I'm going home, you know?
MIN: You're absolutely right bro... you're absolutely right my nigga.
UM6884:But these niggas don't do that, they hang out with anybody. "" Ah Squid, yeah Squid.""
Nigga fuck Squid! You know what I'm saying?
MIN: Squid don't give a fuck about the niggas.
UM6884:He probably set them up. Who knows what happened bro.
MIN: He probably like ""yo listen, ya wanna rob me? Ya could rob these niggas, I'll
play it cool"", you know what I mean? Like chill... niggas is really pussy like that bro. They'll do
that.
UM6884:Yeah but for me... for me, I'll just stay away though. I ain't got no hard feelings towards
Tariq but I know how he is after all these years, so I just stay away, you know?
MIN: Yeah.
UM6884:I know he knows we don't really hang out much, you know? That's just... I just want live
a regular life, you know what I mean? And guess what? Obviously he calls me... ""can you do me
a favor?"" You know?
MIN: Who, Tariq?
UM6884:Of course! Who else is he gonna call? ""Can you do me a favor, do you think you could
shave something off?"" I'm like ""dude... you're always coming to me, you know what I'm saying?
It's your life, you're problems bro... like how many times do I have to help out, you know?""
MIN: Stupid fuck.
UM6884:Especially considering he probably instigated the whole thing, now I gotta pay for your
dumb... you know what I mean?
MIN: Look, let's just say no to him. You say no? You're a fucking faggot...
[Voices Overlap]
UM6884:Of course bro. That's exactly what it is. I never said no. Let me tell him no one time out
of the...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: That's how you see who your real friends are when you say no to a nigga.
UM6884:Yeah but I don't need the test, you understand?
MIN: Yeah I'm just saying though, that's the truth though. When you say no? A real
niggas true color start coming out. You'll see how they act about it. Be like ""you know what,
you're right, it's cool."" They understand.
UM6884:Yeah.
MIN: He's never understanding.
UM6884:He would never understand the no.
MIN: Even if you got it, it's the principal my nigga. It's mine cuz, like I can't do
nothing right now my nigga. I'm trying to do things. It's basically a set back. When he; like when
you do shit like this and you try to help a friend out, you set yourself back, you know what I mean?
UM6884:Yeah.
MIN: It's going back to the same shit... and it's weird. It will never change, you
know what I mean? How will it ever change if you're always stepping back, you know?
UM6884:Yes.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: That niggas always taking the same steps back bro. He does good a few
months, and he's away from everybody. Then goes back. That's why; bro, I was doing the
same... it's the end my nigga. I'm 24, it's not gonna get any better cuz from here if I keep doing
that.
UM6884:Absolutely bro, I mean you are at least sticking out to it right now, you know? Just stay
clear. That's good bro.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: She's freaking hot, don't get me wrong. She's hot... it happened. It happens
to a lot of us, you know what I mean?
UM6884:It's fine, you just gotta change a lot of things, that's all. In you're routine, you're good.
MIN: I know. If I go there to chill, I gotta stay inside. I can't walk to my parents,
nothing. I have to stay there, hang out... but that's it, not in the mood, you know what I mean?
UM6884:Yeah.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: I'm there to come out and go home, you know?
UM6884:100%.
MIN: That's it, I gotta really; I don't care if I'm on a rush no more. I been rushing...
because... I'm not doing it no more, I don't give a fuck. I'm just letting niggas know... yo it's hot,
can't do it.
UM6884:Hey you can't rush. You either make them wait for it or you wake up earlier, or
whatever you gotta do to actually prepare, you know? So you don't rush. Rushings no good,
rushings no good... never... you know? I did that yesterday. I never try to rush. I'd rather...
[Voices Overlap]
