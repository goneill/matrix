UM1003:Really?
MIN: Yeah... this fat bald nigga and a... fat bald nigga and a I think a Spanish

JOHN: Yeah, yup. Those are the two.
MIN: It wasn't nobody who arrested me. 'Cause I was thinking maybe is the

UM1003: Uh-huh
MIN: So, I was thinking like maybe fucking somebody that arrested me... some

JOHN: No! I didn't. I swear to God !
MIN: Are you serious?
[Voices Overlap]
JOHN: It was in the back of the seat.
MIN: No way!
JOHN: Yo,! I'm not even lying to you. I thought I was done, bro. I thought I was getting

[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Oh! Come on!
JOHN: I was so fucking upset, man. I was miserable.
MIN: Oh my God, bro! Yeah, bro. I would have fucking felt [Sighs] pretty fucking
stupid!
JOHN: What happened?
MIN: I would have felt pretty stupid if that happened.
JOHN: Yeah. It is what it is.
MIN: Cause I was in... I didn't see nobody behind you, bro. In the car. I looked. I
was thinking about it. And I was picturing it this morning. I was like.. Yo. You know what I
mean? I was like 'John was driving down the block. I didn't see nobody behind there. It must of
been somebody across from me. You know what I mean? Or on the side.
[Voices Overlap]
JOHN: Yeah.
MIN: Like coming down the street and they...
[Voices Overlap]
UM1003: They must just been sitting at a corner or something somewhere.
MIN: Yeah.
UM1003: What they say to your cousin?
MIN: Nothing. They were like... they pulled him over once he left. He was like
'Yo. Is there a reason you guys doing this?' They asked him right away 'Get out the car.'
He's like 'Yo! What's the matter? What did I do?' You know what I mean? Like...
[Voices Overlap]
UM1003: Yeah
MIN: He just got out the car. And they're searching the car. 'Yous got anything in
the car?' He goes 'Nah! Search the whole car! No problem, man. Go search the whole
thing!' So, they're like 'A'right.' They searched the whole whip. They're like 'A'right' He was
like 'Yo! What was that all that about? ' Like... You know what I mean? They're like 'Yo. We
seen something suspicious here. And the person walked into the house you came out of. ' You
know what I mean? And they're like ... he's like 'Yo. My mom's nephew came over. That's it.
You know what I mean? But, I don't know of anything else.'
UM1003: Wow!
MIN: Yeah. They're like 'Oh. You shouldn't let that person... Be careful of who
you let into your house.' That's what he said to him.
UM1003: Really?
MIN: Yeah. I can't believe you had that shit in your backseat and they didn't find
that shit, bro!
JOHN: Bro! Pshhh! Yo. I really thought I was done. You have no idea. I don't know how
they didn't find it!
[Voices Overlap]
UM1003:Where in your fucking backseat you left it at?
JOHN: Like, you know behind the seat? The pocket in the seat?
UM1003: You left it in there?!
JOHN: [Laughs] Yeah!
UM1003: And he never searched in there?!
JOHN: I guess not.
UM1003: Yeah. It probably looked like it was a part of the seat. Was it flat or...?
[Voices Overlap]
JOHN: No. You can definitely see it's a pocket.
MIN: Maybe they're so thirsty, bro! They were so thirsty they just went right over
it. Right?
[Voices Overlap]
JOHN: Maybe.
MIN: They probably were like 'Yo...' They probably were so fucking... [Aside:
Metro. What are you doing?] .They're so fucking... When you're so like... You know how you're
so thirsty? You look like [Aside: I wanted to make that pop real fast. See how quick that was?]

JOHN: Yo. They were like 'Yo! We know we got you. We got you red handed. Where is it?
Just tell us where it is.'
MIN: [Laughs]
[Voices Overlap]
UM1003: I'd be like 'Yo. You guys. There's nothing in here.' [Chuckles]
JOHN: Yo. In my head. It goes like this: Yo. It's my job to lie. It's your job to find
out. [Laughs]
[Voices Overlap]
UM1003: Yeah. That's it!
[Voices Overlap]
JOHN: You know what I mean? Like... That's what goes through my head. So, when they ask
you. They're like 'Oh. You made it hard.' I'm like 'Yo. It's your fucking job to find out, bro. It's
not my job to tell you.' You know what I mean? Like..
UM1003: Yeah.
JOHN: They were like 'Oh. Just tell us and we'll just give you a DAT.'
UM1003: [Laughs]
JOHN: I'm like 'What kind of DAT are you gonna give me?' They're like ' A Controlled
Substance DAT.' I'm like 'There's no such fucking thing as a Controlled Substance DAT.'
UM1003: [Laughs]
MIN: [Laughs] Oh my God, bro! Yo. You know what they wanted to do? They
wanted to see you grab it. Then it's like 'Yo. Listen. Set your man up.' You know what I mean?
They would have tried to convince you to do that. 'Yo. Bring him here. Line him up.' You
know what I mean? Like... they don't give a fuck about you. They're like 'Line him up.' You

MIN: He's a fucking Bozo, bro. While I was gone... I didn't come back to much
money either. And fucking like whatever. He's like 'Yo. Don't worry. I'll do things.' Like, I didn't
leave it with you 'cause you were busy and all that stuff. So, you know. I left it with him.
Whatever. So, he's always fucking.... But, then I'm hearing that he don't wake up til 7:00 to start

somebody wants a sleeve like he won't tell them. Like, he won't tell me. You know what I mean?
He would just 'I'll make the sale to them.' Like, 'Oh. I'll see.' And once that kid was in front of

Tell him the price.' In my head.

MIN: Bro. Three grand for a month?!

[Stutters] I was just gonna need your cousin for the twenty. To see this Bozo. The Jew. And he
said 'A'right. A'right. I'll tell him.' And he said 'Oh. He doesn't wanna do it.' I was like 'A'ight.'

MIN: Yo.
KERRY: Yo.
MIN: What up?
KERRY: Yo well, between me and you, this phone is going to talk on?
MIN: What are you trying to talk about?
KERRY: Uh, something semi serious.
MIN: What happened?
KERRY I just feel like I should tell you. I met up with Crissy and... Linda and Crissy, you know
what I'm talking about?
MIN: Yeah.
KERRY: A'ight. I met up with her or whatever, because uh... she was having problems selling
her script [prescription] or whatever, because nobody wants to talk with him no more. But, I told
her I would take it, she gave me a decent number and this is the first time I've seen her since.
And uh... make a long story short, as she was talking to me, and I was asking her questions...
MIN: Huh?
KERRY: I was asking her questions and shit, and they say said that they were questioning her

you know what I mean? It is what it is, my nigga.
KERRY: No, no, a hundred percent, but that's not the part that scared me for you. The reason
I'm calling you is she told me that they have you under investigation for three deaths.
MIN: For three deaths?
KERRY: Yeah, like two OD's, people that die.
MIN: Come on, my migga she's not, she's talking out of her ass, bro. I've never

[VOICES OVERLAP]
MIN: [Unintelligle].
KERRY: She just told me that, G, and I figured I had to call you to let you know...

Barras [Phonetic] serving her all that Fentanyl, my nigga... all that dumb shit. She needs to worry
about that, I have nothing to do with anything or whatever she's talking about. So, I have no clue
what the fuck she's talking about.
KERRY: I know, I know.
MIN: Tell her to keep her mouth shut, my nigga. I don't even wanna... When I see
that bitch, I'mma tell her to keep my dick out her mouth, stop talking about me.
KERRY: For real....
MIN: Don't even talk to her about me, bro. Do me a favor, don't talk about me to
anybody, bro.
KERRY: No, I know. She men-... she mentioned it to me.
MIN: Yeah, but don't even ask her, my nigga. You went to... you talked to this
bitch without telling me nothing. You gotta tell me. I always tell you, don't be bringing up to this
bitch up, my nigga. You don't know if she's tapped, my nigga, or if she's wearing a wire. You
have no clue, bro.
KERRY: Yeah, yeah, no I didn't bring you up, she brought you up...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: You should know that, my nigga. Don't do that next time, bro, for real.
KERRY: No, that's what I'm telling you, my nigga, She didn't bring you... I didn't bring you up,
she did. You know what I'm saying. I just asked her... I was like, 'Yo, why you...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: You should stop her. Yo why... I have nothing to do with tha and that's it, my
nigga. Obviously if she brought it up to you, she's trying to get shit on me, my nigga.

MIN: You know what I mean? Like, she... bro, she stays in jail time, my nigga.
They'll do anything for them not to go to jail, my nigga. They'll suck the next nigga's dick that day
for them to stay out of jail
KERRY: Nah, you're right. They're not...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: They don't care, bro. You know what I mean? They'll do whatever. She's
fucking tight nobody is even fucking her, bro. She's gonna talk shit about... Yo bro, how she only
name the people that she fucked with. You know what I mean?
KERRY: Yeah, how the fuck...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: She brought... Why she ain't bring up all the fucking... thousand people that
did that... You know what I mean? She brought up only people she fucked with before. You
know what I mean? Like, that's it, why... Oh, this nigga's investigation, this and that. And they
are not going to tell her, yo, he's investigation. But they're not going tell her leave...
[Voices Overlap]
KERRY: No, no.
MIN: They're not going to tell her, 'Yo, these three people OD (overdosed), so
we're investigating him.' You know what I mean? They are not telling her that shit, my nigga. So
she can run back and tell me, no they're not.
KERRY: Yeah, you're right, you're right. I'm just saying...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: I'm just trying to help you, [Aside: She's out running around in the street
babe. She's out! What do you mean? She just told Kerr, I don't know. I don't talk to her. I stay
away from her. I don't have her number.] They're not gonna do that, my nigga. You know what I
mean? That's like fucking... if you... If I get caught and you're my man, right, I just run back, 'Oh

If you did business with me in the pass or anything, they are not telling you none of that shit.
KERRY: Yeah nah, you're right. You're right...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: They're not doing that, she's fucking talking out her ass. Yo man, let me tell
you something about 'Fiends', bro, real shit. Fiends will do anything to be on your buddy,
buddy side, be realistic, my nigga. They'll do whatever. You know how many stories I heard
about nigga said that, 'Yo, I got arrested, and, and...' And the boys... the boys were like uh... the
boys were like um... yo, they're looking out for you, watching out for you, 'cause if you don't got

a fucking tip, you're the neighbor watch. Let me give you fucking something for being a
neighborhood watch.' That's what they do, my nigga.
KERRY: Yeah, you're right, I agreed with you.
MIN: They gonna do that, bro. And they're gonna do that to you. If they want to
just grab something of you. They're gonna say what they fuck they can when is .... 'cause she's
hurting, my nigga. Who's fucking with her, be realistic. Nobody. You had to fucking take
something from her.
KERRY: Yeah. The only reason I'm doing that, it's 'cause she called me up, she gave me a
retarded number. She called me...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Yo, but stop doing that, my nigga, she's gonna get you, bro. Stop doing
that, I'm telling you.
KERRY: You think I shoul.. You think I should just not even get it?
MIN: Don't do it, my nigga. Yo, if she's trying to be buddy, buddy with you... You
know what I mean? I'm gonna tell her something. Don't say nothing until I'm in the safe side, my
nigga. Obviously not, 'cause you told me. You know what I mean? I'm gonna say, 'Yo, keep my
name out of your mouth, I have nothing to do wih you...'
[Voices Overlap]
KERRY: Yo. Yo honestly, if you want to fucking say something to her, it's on you, go right

that's going to hit me up and tell me.' You know what I mean?
KERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah, I do....

KERRY: I just walked away from that bitch after she got in the house. A'ight. A'ight, bye. She
looked like she just smoked crack, too. So, I wasn't gonna...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: She's a crack head, my nigga. Yo, let me tell you, I'm not taking any fucking
advice about the streets from a fucking crack head. Well, you still can technically, you really
could, honestly. They've been on the streets all their lives. But about information, bro, 'cause
they want to involve me. You know how many times I had niggas tell me, I swear to God this is
ain't the first story. So I thought I was gonna be nervous. First customer told me, I was fucking
nervous as fuck. I've never, my nigga, gave anybody anything that they OD'd ever, ever! Ever in
my life! Ever, bro. Ever. Yo, three deaths, my nigga, I wouldn't be hustling, bro... even at the first
one. You know what I mean?
KERRY: I know, I just felt the need to tell you. She told me that, and I said let me call my nigga
and give him the heads up, you know.
MIN: Yeah, nah, good looking. I appreciate it. But yo, anybody trying to bring me
up to you, my nigga, yo, there is nothing to talk about. Facts. Facts. You already know.

what I mean? Like, I'll call him right now. You should've called me right on the spot.
KERRY: Yeah, you're right. I just wanted to...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: You should've called me on the spot and I would've been like... Yo... I
wouldn't have been mad at you, my nigga. I would've like, Yo... I would've told her, 'Yo, do me a
favor, keep my dick out your mouth.' I would've said that. 'I don't talk about you, I don't care.'
KERRY: Yeah, you know what it is? I just wanted to get the fuck away from her, this bitch looks
banged. You know what I'm saying? I didn't want to...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Yeah, but she smokes crack, though. She's a known... one of the biggest
known crack head in New Dorp, dawg. For real, for real.

JOHN and MIN greet
MIN: What happened?
JOHN: [Stutters] I picked Ava up. Because I haven't used the... I still haven't used it. She had
one of her bags in the backseat. One of her Mickey bags. So, I went to go get it.. And the
whole fucking thing is a wreck. I'm like 'What the fuck?' Everything is all ripped out from the
fucking glove box and from the fucking console. So, I was like 'What the fuck is going on?' So, I
opened the trunk. There's nothing in the trunk. My fucking computer.... you know. The scanner.
MIN: Mm-hmm.
JOHN: My scanner is gone. And all the tools.
MIN: And what happened to your neighbor now?
JOHN: I don't know. He said they went through his car too. We both... They fucking
ransacked through his car too.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: They stole shit outta your neighbor's car too?
JOHN: Yup. Everything outta the trunk. He said he had a brand new jack back there. Not the
dick neighbor. The guy on the other side. Like... the Hindu guy.
MIN: Oh. They were cool? They didn't say nothing bad?
JOHN: What?
MIN: They don't say nothing bad? Like 'Oh. 'Cause people came there before'
?
JOHN: No. No. No. He's fucking just waiting for the cops. I'm fucking fuming. The fucking
thing is 120 bucks. My computer.
MIN: Did Cucc [Stutters] When Cucc came did he bring anybody back there?
JOHN: Who?
MIN: Cucc.
JOHN: No. Any time he came he just came late.
MIN: You know Cucc knows about that spot. Right? He tells.... He has a big
mouth. He tells alot of people too. I'm being so real with you. 'Cause he always tells me. 'Oh.
Cuz tells me to leave shit in the Passat.' Dah, dah, dah. I'm being real with you. You know what
I mean?
JOHN: Yeah. Well, when Amina was home. You know what I mean? If I'm hanging out with
Amina I couldn't run outside. So, I'd just told him to tell him 'Leave it in the car. Leave it in the
Passat.'
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: I know. But, he has a big ass mouth. I don't know if he's all junkied out. I
don't know what's going on with him.
JOHN: Maybe he's being spiteful. Or being a dick. 'Cause he... you cut him off. I didn't even
think of him. I didn't even think of him. I'm gonna tell 'em to dust the car for prints.
MIN: Yeah. But, my fingerprints are on that car too. You know that. Right?
JOHN: What?
MINA; My fingerprints are on it from the other night. Remember I told you I tried checking the
doors and it wasn't open?
JOHN: Right. Right.
MIN: You know what I mean? So...
JOHN: No. I'm gonna have 'em do inside the car.
MIN: Oh yeah. 'Cause everybody touches outside. Yeah.
JOHN: Outside... a million people touch the car.
MIN: You're right. You're right. You're right. Yeah. No. Yeah. Your doors are all
locked.
[Voices Overlap]
JOHN: I just.... Your my cousin. I just took you for a ride. No one else has been inside the car
though. The last prints inside the car has gotta be the fucking ... who fucking went through it.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: You gotta lie and say you had alot of expensive shit in the back. You gotta
say 'Yo. I had mad fucking stuff in there, bro. There's alot of shit missing, bro. I wan't
somebody's fingerprints. I really want 'em to go to fucking jail!'
[Voices Overlap]
JOHN says the only thing he can do is put a claim in to his homeowner's insurance
MIN tells JOHN to do that. JOHN says Amina's Aunt is the insurance rep so she can just put it
through.
JOHN: Thank God I took my wallet out. 'Cause I haven't been using the car. So, I took my
wallet out. And my brother had the Tiguan. [Phonetic]
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: [Aside: Where your phone at? Oh. Up there.]
JOHN says Amina is in Atlantic City.
[MIN continues to talk aside with his gir]
MIN: Yeah. But, the only thing is Cucc. That nigga chills with all junkies.
JOHN: I didn't even think of him.
MIN: All he does is get high with all those junkies That's why I don't fuck with that
nigga no more. He's a faggot.
JOHN: Yeah. But, I would always see him come in.
He knows that.
MIN: Yeah. But, why would he go...out of all cars... in your car?
JOHN: Well, it's the guy next door too., It wasn't just me.
I mean... But , the cars are right next to each other.
MIN: That's what I'm saying. Think about it. No? Why would he go to those two
cars. He didn't try no other car around there?
JOHN says the rest of the neighbors use their garages.
JOHN: The guy on the end. The black guy. He's a cop. He works late at night. I don't know.
I'm waiting for the cops to come. I don't know. See what they tell me. I gotta fill out a report.
JOHN goes on to say he was out there cursing and screaming and the neighbor asked if they
stole stuff from JOHN's car too. The neighbor said he noticed they robbed stuff outta the cars
this morning.
JOHN says he's glad he took his wallet out of the car and they weren't able to steal his identity.
JOHN says Amina is in AC. Amina won 2800 dollars on slots.
MIN and JOHN talk about John's daughter getting big now.
MIN: So, yo. You didn't find those fucking three? .
JOHN: No. I didn't find nothing. I'm wondering if the same fucking asshole that took them
came back and still robbed the cars. But, I don't know. But, that makes more sense now. Cucc.
Now I'm fucking bugging about him. You think he's following me around?
MIN : I don't know, bro. I look around me alot lately.
JOHN: Yeah? I know you're usually careful. Let me call you after the cops get here.
MIN: A'ight, bro .

what I'm saying?
MIN: Right.
KERRY: I bring mad business his way. Now, all the numbers that I gave him and all the people I

business associates.

KERRY: Yo. I got this nigga, Cucc, picking me up. 'Cause I need him to give me a ride or
whatever. What exactly does he have to give you? Just so I make sure he does it today.
MIN: Uh.... my phone and he has to give me seventy dollars. He can give it to
me, nigga. I don't need you to do nothing for me. Don't worry about it.
KERRY: Oh. Nah. Nah. Nah. I was talking to him. I wasl ike 'Yo. What do you gotta give to
him. 'Cause you gotta give it to him today.' He was like 'Oh. His phone.' I was like ' A'ight.
So, go grab his phone...'
MIN: All I know is my numbers better be in there. Everything. else. Nothing
better been deleted.
KERRY: Yo. Check this out. He was like ' Oh and I'm only gonna give this nigga forty.' I was
like ' What are you gonna give him forty for? You said seventy.' He was like ' I only owe this
nigga forty. He's just trying to hit me with interest.'
MIN: No, nigga! H's a fucking liar! I'mma... Yo!
KERRY: So, look.... what I'mma do is...
MIN: My nigga! What the fuck I need to hit him for interest, bro? For what?
KERRY: That's what I said.
MIN: Why the fuck I need to do that? Be realistic, my nigga! I wasn't making no
bread with that nigga anyway.
KERRY: Nah. Nah.
MIN: Waiting two days fucking for money, my nigga.
KERRY: Yeah. So... Look. I think all he has is forty on him. But, just so I could take care of this
for you.
MIN: I don't want you at fault at all. I'm good. You know what I mean? It's
between me and Cucc. Nobody else.
KERRY: I know, my nigga. But, you always did the right thing by that nigga. So, by him not
doing the right back to you is like. fucked up.
MIN: I'm not worried about that nigga! You think I'm fucking worried about that
nigga, bro? For real. I want my fucking phone. That's it. I have nothing to do with no business
with that nigga to talk to that nigga about. He has a fucking big ass mouth! Telling everybody
my fucking business! You know? Niggas telling me all these stories. How do these niggas
know these stories? You know what I mean? I don't even know why he wants you to come. He
thinks I'm gonna slap that nigga or something!
KERRY: Yeah.
MIN: He gets a little smartass on the phone.
KERRY says Cucc did ask KERRY to come because Cucc doesn't want to get smacked from
MIN.
MIN: I'll still slap him, my nigga. I don't give a fuck who he's with! It don't matter.
Even a hundred niggas! He knows that already.
[Voices Overlap]
KERRY: My nigga. You already know I ain't doing nothing, nigga. He ain't my boy like that. It's
not my nigga like that. To jump in. You know what I'm saying? And it ain't my place either. You
know what I'm saying? You and him did work.
MIN: {Aside: Yo, Ray! What up?] One second, bro. One second.
[MIN puts KERRY on hold]
KERRY and MIN continue to discuss that Cucc is not built for this shit. MIN goes on to say he
was texting with Cucc and Cucc was getting smart on the text.
MIN: Nigga. I'mma be so real with you. You know we got knocked. His hands
were shaking, nigga. He was trying to argue [Stutters] I had a pound in the trunk. And 20
bunds, nigga. I got knocked down in Brooklyn. The cops kept asking the nigga why he was so
nervous. If he would have fucking folded I would have fucking demolished him right in front of the
boys. His hands were shaking but Thank God the cops thought he was all pussy white boy or
something. You know what I mean?
Conversation continues about Cucc thinks because he rocked with KERRY and MIN and met
people through them Cucc is on the same level with KERRY and MIN.
KERRY: My nigga. I told him yesterday, bro. Me and him got into a thing yesterday. He was
trying to do some snake shit. I told him straight up, the nigga. I was like 'Yo, dawg. I'll stab you,
my nigga. Don't think because we're friends. When it comes to my money I will stab you, nigga.'
KERRY says he feels like smacking Cucc lately too.

MIN: This kid Anthony, he messes up big time.
UF7569: Why?
MIN: He testified. They put him on the stand... he testified and he said that he
shot her by accident.
UF7569: He shot her by accident?
MIN: Yeah, before he was saying he never did it, when they went to court, when
they went to trial, in the beginning, they were saying, 'He never did it.' The lawyer was like,
'How did he shoot you from this and this and...' You know he never did it.
UF7569: Okay.
MIN: Now he went on stand, and he said he did it by accident. The fucking
accident.
UF7569: By accident , How by accident, and now?
MIN: Yeah. No, he tried to kill himself first and Brianna stopped him. The real
story is; he tried to kill himself first. He tried to shoot himself in the head. That really happened,
she tried to stop him and he shot her. He's trying to say it's by accident.
UF7569: He was faking as if he wanted to shoot himself because he was not going to kill
himself
MIN: He's done now. He's going to get proven guilty.
UF7569: What have they punish him?
MIN: No they are not punishing but it is up to the jury

At one o'clock, my nigga. People... mad people were calling me. I just got rid of my shit. I had

on top for the fucking other one. But, let me see I grab more bread first. Before you grab for
me to try.
UM8902: A'ight. For which one?
MIN: Uh.... I don't know. Which one is the best one, bro?
UM8902: I would say the OG. Plus, I have it broken down. So...
MIN: Is it really fluffy?
UM8902: It's regular. I wouldn't call it like too fluffy.
MIN: What else is good? Really good?
[Voices Overlap]
UM8902: My next choice....
MIN: She said this. Hold on. Yo. Listen. Grab a few samples for me. I got
somebody in the city that my girl used to cop bud off. The nigga had a hard time getting some
for three or four days. So, I told him... I had a conversation before. Like two weeks ago. I
was like 'Yo! Why don't you never hit me up, my nigga? I got that! That's why I haven't been
calling you. I been grabbing like bud and weed and shit. ' I said 'But, I don't keep my shit out
here. I bring it.' He's like ' I got you.' He's like 'Yo. Grab some for me and show me. Grab
me a few samples.' I said 'Yo. My mans get different flavors though. ' And I was like I'm
being... I told him the prices. I was mad... Yo. I was realistic with him. I was like 'Yo. My nigga.
On some real shit.' I'm like ' I get mad... all indoors, bro. Like all fire indoors. You know what I
mean? ' Like the price varies. I was like 'They go high.' But, he understood me. He actually
understood. He didn't complain. He goes ' Yo, my nigga. If it's 26 and it's fire I'll take it, bro.' I
said 'Sometimes there 27 or 28.' He goes ' Yo. If it's legit. If it's worth it. I'll take it.' He

Now they see that I'm trying to get custies back. Some niggas don't even... Junkies don't even
wanna fuck with me. They're like... I left them for dead, bro. I left mad niggas for dead. For dead
like...
[Voices Overlap]
JACKIE: Why?
MIN: Well.... the feens though. But, I gave them to other people. I was selling... I
was doing my getting.... I was doing my boat [Phonetic] thing.
JACKIE: Well, you gonna get them back! 'Cause feens is just feens, babe! Don't stress
yourself out!
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: It's just fucking annoying, bro. Anything. I don't have a whip! Nothing, my
nigga. I can't do shit! Or depend on anybody. Any little damn move I try to make. Anything.
JACKIE: That's how it gets when you get older, babe. That's called getting older. I know it don't
feel good.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: I had everybody doing everything for me. Now I don't have the bread.
[Voices Overlap]
JACKIE: A'right. And that's your problem!
MIN: That's why if I had the bread I would have had niggas
sucking my big toe.
[Voices Overlap]
JACKIE: You depend on too many people, babe.
MIN: When I had the bread everyone was sucking my big toe.
JACKIE: It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter! Trust me. I know what you mean.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: I blew my bread. Everything.
JACKIE: I know what you mean. But, that's not the way to live either. See, all the bread you
giving out you could be keeping. So, trust me. This is called growing up. Nobody's there in your
hand and foot anymore. You don't got nobody that's coming to scoop you and drop you to
Staten Island. It's okay. You know why? 'Cause you're gonna struggle. You're gonna feel what
it's like to struggle. You're gonna get your shit right. And you gonna end up having your own car!
So, stop stressing out.
MIN: You know I have to do things? You know I have to pay half the rent the end
of the month? I don't have that. I don't take you on vacation. I haven't gotten you shit. Do you
know that? And you saying all this shit to me. [Stutters] Do you know it bothers me? That's why
I'm stressing. You don't get that.
[Voices Overlap]
JACKIE: I know, babe. But, you also gotta understand. Your actions. The shit that you be
doing. Doesn't make me feel....
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Yeah. But, it's hard. I don't know how to control it. I never been through
shit like this! Ever! I was never able to say I don't got nothing for nobody!
[Voices Overlap]
JACKIE: A'ight, babe. You gotta learn. You gotta learn to control it. 'Cause, I'm here for you.
But, I'm not gonna keep going through this unnecessary bullshit. I'm just not gonna do it. But, you
know I'm here for you.
MIN: Honestly, I just don't wanna talk about this right now. I'm at the ferry, bro. I
just wanna go have a beer.
[Voices Overlap]
JACKIE: But, why you even going to Staten Island then? Maybe you don't need to go if you not
gonna make no bread.
MIN: I'm going, bro! I just is. I'm going through something.
[Voices Overlap]
JACKIE: A'ight.
MIN: I'm going.
JACKIE: I'm just saying. Hanging out with Pupi for his birthday. That don't sound like a good
idea to me. But, you know what? Do whatever you wanna do.
MIN: What happened?
JACKIE: It's funny you just now telling me it's his birthday. You didn't tell me that earlier that you
y'all was hanging out for his birthday
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: I knew... I don't even wanna chill there, bro! He's having a barbecue with a
few heads. I don't even wanna chill there. What are you talking about?
MIN and JACKIE engage in an argument about MIN not telling JACKIE about going to Pupi's for
his birthday.
JACKIE tells MIN he needs to learn how to communicate and calm down.
JACKIE tells MIN she wants him to be okay and she doesn't want him stressing out.
MIN: I was never like this. I never gave up. I always tried. I always pushed.
JACKIE: Maybe it never got that hard for you Maybe you needed it to get hard. It's okay.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: It did, bro! I'm telling you! It did, man! It did!
It really fucking did, bro.
JACKIE: And you got back up. Right?
MIN: Yeah. But, it's taking months. It's fucking ridiculous!
[Voices Overlap]
JACKIE: So, then it gotta take months.
MIN: A'ight. I'm going out there to pick up my phone anyway. I wanna grab my
work phone.
JACKIE: A'ight, babe. Just call me.
MIN: A'ight. I love you.
JACKIE: I love you too. Bye.

MIN: Is Pupi home?
UF7569: No why?
MIN: Alright, what was I going to tell you... don't have Adam; when Adam comes

MIN: He steals shit from the convenient store, the fucking bum.
UF7569: He steal from convenient store?
MIN: Yeah, the other day... yup.
UF7569: What he steal?
MIN: I don't know because... Medin went in front of the convenient one day... he
seen Pupi and him and Pupi were just talking for like 20 minutes; and Adam comes there... and
obviously, you know whatever... you know Adam still lies and says 'oh I never stole from you, I
never stole from you', he always denies it... so then Medin; it's like yo, everybody knows you
stole from me bro, like your own girlfriend told me, you know? Whatever, they talking and stuff...
and shit... so um... [Aside: Yo! [Unintelligible]! Whaddup?] Yeah so um... I was gonna say, so that
happened, and um... so whatever, they just talking and then uh... I'm like; I'm looking at him...
what am I saying? Medin is telling me he is. He's like whatever arguing with him, talking, going
back and forth, then um... the owner; not the owner, the worker comes outside. He's like 'listen',
he goes um 'stop coming here... you're not aloud here no more.' And he said it cause you
stealing and stuff. And then uh... Pupi, was like 'listen', he told Adam like 'yo just'... you know?
Medin was like 'why don't you just apologize? Just say I'm sorry, I was on drugs', just admit it,
you know what I mean? Why you can't be real; be a man, just tell me 'I'm on drugs, I made a
mistake'... you know what I mean? Like... and he was like 'I didn't do it, I still didn't do it', you
know what I mean? 'Somebody else did it.' And Pupi was like 'yo, everybody knows you did it
bro, just say sorry, that's it.' And he's like 'I didn't do it', so.
UF7569: Iliri said, Liri said you did it?
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Yeah, everybody knows. Everybody knows! Nobody is stupid no more.
[Voices Overlap]
UF7569: Okay, okay, and then?
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Pupi was like 'yo, everybody knows man. Everybody knows you did it. Just
say you're sorry, that's it.' It wasn't about he did it anymore. Medin it's like, he's a piece of shit
cause he don't fucking even say sorry to me no more. He don't do drugs no more right? Why
don't you come apologize to me, and fucking say 'I messed up. I did something wrong', you
know?
[Voices Overlap]
UF7569: Okay don't scream, don't scream, don't scream.
MIN: Yeah, whatever I'm in front of the barber shop. I'm still in Staten Island. I've
been waiting to get a hair cut for two hours almost.
UF7569: And then?
MIN: Nothing so, he um... so then that's when the guy comes out; he can't be
here no more. He said that he was stealing from the store... or whatever... so um.
UF7569: Okay, When did he steal from the store, when?
MIN: A few times, like three times. He said he caught him a few times going in
there.
UF7569: Yeah?
MIN: He's a fucking bump. Now he gets drunk everyday. I asked super [Phonetic]
. I said, 'where does he work at?' And he was like 'I don't know.'
UF7569: He gets drunk everyday?

everyday.
UF7569: Here, when he comes, he comes with beers.
MIN: Everyday, so that's; I'm telling him, I don't even want him hanging out there.
Everyday I been coming there, I see him outside the house... like you know; Pupi doesn't get.
Nobody knows.
[Voices Overlap]
UF7569: Pupi doesn't get 'cause Pupi has his own interest, because he leaves the car at
theirs driveway [Unintelligible]
MIN: He don't care. He uses him. I know he uses him. I know that he uses him, he
don't give a fuck. He uses him, that's it... you know? Adam's a bum, he has nothing to do all day.
Pupi leaves the car there, then he goes to work. I told; like I didn't tell Pupi about it. I said 'the
only reason he hangs with you is cause he has nothing to do all fucking day.' Nobody else hangs
out with him. Let all my old friends come back into his life... 'oh come out with us.' He'll never
hang out with you no more.
UF7569: Yeah, yeah, and your brother don't know what to do because he is on vacations five,
six, weeks and that's why he hangs out with them.

simple as that. You know? Whatever.
UF7569: That's it, my 'mom yelling and screaming, don't want to see somebody in the house',
that's it. 'My mom doesn't like nobody in the house.' Simple as that. Even Anila [PH] hasn't been

MIN: Cause I told him, I said something to him, right away. He knew! He knew I

Pupi passed by, I was FaceTime him. You know I can see his face.

UF7569: Like his father, his father you know, is like that,

JASMIN calls dad and says he doesn't know what dad is doing every weekend in Yonkers
doing no job and bringing no money home. JASMIN asks dad to give to him job over the
weekend because he wants to make some money.
Most of the call is overlapping and arguing. JASMIN says to dad you want to know about me and
I want to know about you.
DAD says that I don't need to report my son and JASMIN calls dad a liar that is hiding everything
from mom.
JASMIN says that he gets everything and he knows everything that goes around.
JASMIN says to dad that he can not lie anymore.

JASMIN: I am calling because I am owe some money for the storage.
UF4507 asks JASMIN for the unit number but JASMIN says he does not know it because his
father is the one that put all the stuff( Jasmin's) into the unit.
JASMIN gives UN4507 the name of his father Skender CEJOVIC.
UF4507: The balance is 668
JASMIN: 668 , why is that?
UF4507: It is two months rent and the late fees. And the stuff is due for auction on October 3rd.
JASMIN: There is a miscommunication. I was away and he told me he paid. [Unintelligible]. And
it is all my stuff in there. None a single thing is his. Everything in there is my. And he moved my
stuff. I was away for a few months. And I don't have any control on this. It is all my stuff in there.
And I don't have all the money to pay right now, the 668.
UF4507: 668 has to be paid at least before September 14.
JASMIN and UF4507 talk about payment options for the remaining amount.

UM9394:Nah, nah, nah.
MIN: Are you sure?
UM9394:Positive. They don't even know shit about us, bro. It was the wrong place, wrong time
situation.
MIN: So, why do they keep coming around then my nigga? I don't get it. Was
Gino talking? Cause I will violate Gino bro. I'll violate him.
UM9394:Bro it has to be... Gino. Them niggas don't know where I live. I never brought them to
my crib.
MIN: I'll violate Gino bro. I'm telling you I'll violate, I'm not playing. Like I'm really
serious bro. If he's fucking telling niggas where my parents live at and shit, I'll beat... bro.
UM9394:All these problem niggas are like hitting me up weirdly back to back.

UM9394:The trap game niggas.
MIN: Why are they hitting you up? For what?
UM9394:That's what I'm saying.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Bro, I tried telling you bro... I don't know why the fuck you chill with people
like that. I don't get it bro, you never get through your head bro. Like these motherfuckers is really
pussy bro, they're not like that. They all want to talk all this life style, all this game, they're not like
that bro. That's my point. Don't fucking chill with them. Gino's fucking pussy. Remember that time
I fucking... I [Unintelligible]? He kept on looking at me and I told you 'what's up with him? Bro I will
slap the shit out of him if he keeps on looking at me like that. I don't know why', like... you know
what I mean? Like just the way he is. His Ora bro, his Ora's fucking disgusting bro. I would want
fucking want to rob somebody like that too if I was fucking... but I don't need to do that bro.
Dudes is fucking losers bro. I'm fucking 24. I don't live here no more and I still gotta go through
this shit bro. And you gotta get that, like I don't even know why you chill over there. He brings
everybody in that house bro... everybody. I ran into Michelle yesterday; she told me 'yo I feel like
mad people coming in and out of this crib all the time.' And he thinks everybody fucks with him
bro. He's a nobody. I've never even heard of this kid... ever in my life. Ever bro. I've never even
heard this kid existed.
UM9394:He don't leave his crib.
MIN: He don't leave his crib. He's a fucking little bitch house boy bro. I
[Unintelligible] studio. Always [Unintelligible]. I always see snaps of him dozed off on Mark's
snaps or whatever; all these niggas. All I see him doing.
UM9394:Yep, that sounds right.
MIN: Yo I will drag him out his fucking house, I'm telling you. I hope bro Tag you're
not lying.
UM9394:What?
MIN: I hope you're not lying bro, that you said that they know about me, cause I
don't be fucking... bro I don't even know these motherfuckers.
[Voices Overlap]
UM9394:Bro listen, why would I lie? That's first of all, and secondly... basically I'ma tell you from
start to B [Phonetic]. Madder of fact yesterday... you're absolutely right bro. I could even show
you the conversation my nigga, like... after you told me that? I had some shooter nigga come out
from Far Rock to show nigga. Bro we went by the crib and he backed it up bro, and was gonna
light the shit up. And when I started thinking of Michelle, the niggas mom and the niggas know
where I live. And I was just like 'yo bro, nah, nah, nah, nah.'
MIN: To do it where, at Gino?
UM9394:Yeah.
MIN: Why, cause they were at Gino's last night.
UM9394:That's where they b bro. They basically extorting this nigga and he's not saying
anytihng, you get what I'm saying? Like they just be chilling at his crib all day, they take his weed,
they smoke his bud, they fucking roll themselves cigarettes. He got a cigarette machine
downstairs. Like these is dingy dirty hood niggas that found themselves a new home.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: So they coming by because of this bozo nigga.
UM9394:Yes, and then me and Reek got him there.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: See, how does he know about me? Cause niggas probably said
something nigga. He probably knows; he probably seen me, asked who the fuck I was. Yo I
would violate, let him know bro... that they are not gonna be around him all his life bro. Tell him
that. Like let him know that sincerely... that I said that personally. I hope niggas come out hand, I
will fucking murder him in my hands bro. Bringing people in my parents house bro... I don't even
know this kid from a whole in the wall bro. I don't even know who the fuck is he.
UM9394:Whole shit is [Unintelligible].
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Mother fucker walked by like I was suppose to be scared of something. I
looked him straight in his eye bro. He walked by; my father was in the crib. I don't know if he
[Unintelligible] bro.
UM9394:This nigga Juno [Phonetic] bro, everybody hates him right now.
MIN: What's up with Mark? He still goes there. I see his car all the time.
UM9394:Bro Mark be trying to play it like he's trying to do us a favor and get us information...
you know what I'm saying? To help us out bro, but I don't know man. I stay away from there.
Anybody that fucks with them, I don't talk to them anymore.
MIN: Why, Mark knows these kids too?
UM9394:Not on a personal level bro, but... not on a personal level.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: So why are they not doing this to Mark though, I don't get it. That's why I
don't understand. Mark might be saying some shit too bro. I don't trust none of them mother
fuckers.
[Voices Overlap]
UM9394:I think so. Nigga, when we was in the crib bro, Mark was there. He didn't do anything.
He swallowed spit, trembling bro and playing 2k my nigga. I even got into multiple arguments
with him about this. He just kept giving me the days and said themselves if we would have
intervened or got involved, it wouldn't help and there was nothing... it wouldn't have changed the
outcome. It wouldn't change anything. And then he still going back there too and when I press
him on it, he's like 'oh nah, I'm just trying to keep my ears up. Be careful bro.'
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: I'm gonna call him up myself right now. I'm like 'yo what's up? Why niggas
coming by my crib? I don't even know niggas? Like I wanna know this. I'm dying to know.'
UM9394:Shit is crazy.
MIN: Like I'm dying to know bro, like what's up with these motherfuckers bro. I
see Marks car outside everyday looking all busted; flat tires, everything. I see that shit walking by
all the time.
UM9394:Bro, I wouldn't even trust him son... know what I'm saying? I'm not even bringing it up to
him. I don't know bro, I don't trust anybody right now.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: I don't care, I'll let him know that I know bro. I know... that I personally know
what's going on.
UM9394:I don't trust nobody, I've been staying away from everybody. That whole shit was a
mess bro, like... I've never been in such a predicament in my life son. And niggas...

MIN: I figured that, I know that.
MARK: Yeah.
MIN: So whatever. I stop, I'm walking by myself but walking my dog, I walked to
my parent's house. I was at my parents' house for the whole day. I walked there... then I.. I see the

what I mean? Maybe I'm bogging. Maybe no mother fuckers are after me, I don't know, you know
what I mean?
MARK: Yeah.
MIN: So I go on the crib. Dumb. So, I go back outside on the front. My pops had
to drop me off home because I have the dog with me. They said, 'I will take you home,'
whatever. I got you, you got your dog with you.' So that's what I'm doing. I'm in the front of the
crib, I'm waiting, I'm waiting, and my pops come in front of the crib with my husky saying about to
walk him a'right, so I see the car pass by again and pass by again. I'm like, ' this mother fucker
are up to no good, obviously I don't know what's going on. so I'm thinking like alright, I don't think
is gonna happen 'cause my pop is in the front. Maybe some fool is gonna wait that I'm solo, you
know what I mean? whatever. So my pops... some nigga get out of the car, he starts walking to
my crib. I'm looking at him eye to eye I never took my eyes once. So I can get a clear vision of
his face bro. never took my eyes once. Whatever. Then I don't know where he is walking by,
whatever and he is like, he looks at my pops and he says, 'Nice dog' and my pop is, 'Thanks
buddy, I appreciate it.' You know what I mean? he kept on walking, he jumped on the wit again.
And whatever, in the bounce.
MARK: Hello?
MIN: And I never seen him again, bro. And I called Tack [Phonetic] and I still

sentences and that's why he got robbed, you know what I'm saying. He ended up right trying like
see him his citizenship before even with, like with Rick, he was in a fight mode [Phonetic] with
his mouth. I don't know he was telling nigga, 'Mind your fucking ....' Telling nigga this and that,

MARK: Yeah, because they robbed Rick too. And they were call the boy, call the boy.
MIN: Wait, wait, they knew, they knew... they said, call his boys...
MARK: They were like, 'call your boy, call your boy Rick' because Rick supposedly, there was
some shit going on were, niggas took Gino's chain. The nigga went over his [Unintelligible] so
that's main reason why everything happened. Tarick [Phonetic] wasn't even there. He come
through with mad gang members, this is the [Unintelligible] telling square, 'yo square,
[Unintelligible] that to me' so the nigga is looking at this nigga like he is fool already but not
doing anything for this man.
MIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MARK: Then yet, the nigga is talking about the two nigga that could stole the chain. This nigga
Tarick is like, 'Well, I know Rick, and is not really in his caliber, is not really in his character to

got robbed bro. Tariq got robbed, he got robbed because... again he didn't keep his mouth
shut. The second time. They were robbing his boy and now his boy.. whatever, some shit
happened between his boy and them. It was their beef. It has nothing to do with Tariq. It was their

MIN: [Aside: One second.] Yeah, what's up?
JACKIE: I have the money and the card. Why you even over there?
MIN: I'll tell you after. You didn't let me finish. [Aside: I don't know. I'll be back. I
have to go somewhere. No... What? I don't know I have to check. I'm on the phone.] I have to go
over here. I found what happened yesterday. I spoke to fucking Mark. This nigga Tag [Phonetic]
is a fucking faggot, blaming somebody else. I'm a tell you right now. I came in to talk to my mom
and tell her. My brother called me too. I said, 'Don't stay in front of the house too much. Stay
away in front of the crib right now.' This dumb nigga walked to the house. These niggaas were
strapped. Mark kept it real with me. I spoke to Mark on the phone. 'These nigga is strapped bro.
These niggas all got burned. Every single got burned, they were all strapped. I'll never lie to you
my nigga. They all strapped, all them niggas got gunned.' That nigga that walked by last night?
100% had the burn on him. That's why he was all confident to walk by like that. You know what I
mean?
JACKIE: Yeah.
MIN: Stupid bro. I will tell you what happened. I never told you the shit with Tarry
[Phonetic]. He involved, some big homie, some big blood nigga, he came home from jail. He
was copping sticks with tag. [Stammers] This is mad long ago, when I lived Chris [unintelligible]
apartment. He involved my name in some shit. This nigga. I spoke with him on the phone three
way with them niggas. Tara [Phonetic] banged the phone. The blood nigga called me because
Tara [Phonetic] gave him my number. He said, 'Yo, I robbed Tar, I booked him, you got nothing
to do with this.' I don't even know what's going on. The nigga was telling me this. I was like,
'What you talking about.' I called Tar, Tar is like, 'Yeah, the nigga said this, he'll violate. Tara
[Phonetic] is a bird. He just threw my name in the air. So I can fight and knock niggas out.
Whatever.
JACKIE: Recently or back in the day?
MIN: Before. But my mom knows about this. This is when I beat the shit out of
him and his mom called the cops. Remember when I told you his mom called the cops and I had
to hop the fence and shit.
JACKIE: Yeah?
MIN: The cops ran into my house. My mom had to take the camera wires off
because they wanted to see the cameras where I ran and shit. They didn't know who I was. My
mom had lied. So... pretty much... this time... this dumb nigga... Didn't keep his mouth shit.
Basically when he ran into this kid's crib, the kid's studio, they didn't run into the crib. They are all
chilling there. There was beef with Tarry's [Phonetic] boy, Ric [Phonetic]. I know Ric too
personally. They wanted Ric to come too because they wanted to violate him. It was their beef.
Tarry wasn't involved in it, it was his man's but.. he dug himself in his own hole. You know what I
mean? So pretty much. Tarry was like, 'Nah, fuck out of here. Niggas pull their guns, matter fact,
we pull our shit out too.' They robbed him, Tarry and Ric, they are not gangsters my nigga. I don't
care how much of heart you have to fight. Not a shooter bro. They never go back there. Tarry's
little brother is raps too, he's nice or whatever. They call his brother like, 'Yo, you got nothing to
do with this bro.' They called his brother like, 'Yo, you got nothing to do with this bro.' They
called his brother. 'He ran his mouth, acted all hard, that's why we did that to that nigga. But you,
you good. You got nothing to do with this.' They told his little brother that. Mark told me all of this.
I called Mark today. 'I spoke to Tar [Phonetic] again. Let me call this nigga one more time. ' He
always fucks up his story. So when I asked him, 'Did you talk about me?' He was like, 'Nah.' I
was like, 'Yo, Mark still chilled over there? You said Mark anything?' He such a fucking faggot,
he threw Mark right under the bus mad quick. I know Mark would never talk about me. He has no
reason to talk about me. So... whatever... Tar is knows for this. My friend would tell you. He was
like,
Yeah, probably. I don't doubt it. That nigga is chilling there. He was saying all this. I was like,
'Yeah? No problem?' So... I called Mark, Mark is like, 'Bro. You good?' I said, 'Be honest with
me, they came by crib yesterday.' He said, 'Alright, i'll tell you everything. I told him, 'Tarry told
me a story and I'll tell you after. I need to hear shit first.' He tells me everything. I knew Tarry's
story was fishy. He told me, 'Honest with you, Tarry has a big fucking mouth. He could have
avoid it. He opened his mouth and saw he got robbed.'
MIN tells JACKIE that TARRY never owes up to anything.
MIN: I asked him, 'Do niggas know about me?' He said, 'Word to my mother,
niggas not know about you at all.' 'Let me know. That's it.' 'You never got brought up.' I never
chilled with them. I have no reason to get brought up there. I never hang out there. They always
talk about music, always doing Xanax. I don't sell them Xans, nothing. I do nothing with them. Not
any little single thing. I said, 'Honestly, my nigga. I asked Tar, did Mark say anything?' That
nigga said you probably did.' He said, 'My nigga. Are you fucking serious?' While I'm talking to
Mark, Tarry is texting him. Tarry is texting him, 'Yo, Min is going to call you. Whatever you say,
just keep it short and simple.' To cover his fucking ass. So i'm going to tell Mark to send me the
screenshots.
MIN tells JACKIE that MARK is not a bir and he will send him the screen-shots.
MIN: My mom goes, 'Be here at 8:30 because his mom comes home. I want
them out this fucking house. You are gonna tell his mother.' I was like, 'Whatever I will. For that I
will. If it's for my safty.' I will tell her, 'Your son, is fucking again.' I was telling my moms, 'I don't
even think about this shit no more. Beef, shoot, I don't give a fuck about that.' I told my mom, 'I
was talking to my girl, how to bring my credit up again, to fix shit like that, fix my school loan.' I'm
worried about those kind of stuff right now. Why should I be worried about this?' Niggas is sad
bro.
MIN tells JACKIE he told MARK to have him speak to him and MARK agreed.
MIN tells JACKIE he hadn't been there since the robbery.
MIN: I asked him about the extortion thing, he goes, 'Honestly, think they are
really extorting, they are walking out the niggas crib like they own the place. Smoking that niggas
weed.' This kid Gino with the studio, they one they robbed, they violate, they are extorting that
nigga. They are making that nigga give them his money. He is the one that I wanted to slap at the
Funky Elephant, when went to eat. I kept on grilling him for no reason. This nigga is pussy. I
wouldn't doubt Gino probably gave Tarry a couple... 'He lives there.' They didn't know where he
lived at.
JACKIE and MIN engage in a social conversation regarding the country MONTENEGRO and
that is where MIN'S family and JACKIE'S friend is from there also.
MIN: I'm waiting for my cousin to pick me up. He's not ready yet. He had to do
something with his father, 'Give me a few. I'm running errands with my dad.' I I should taken that
Benydryl. I should have got up, woke his up and went straight to Brooklyn and did everything
today. Fuck. [brief pause] He has his money in the card?
JACKIE: Yeah, to pay the thing.
MIN: Alright, I'm going to send it to you right now. Go to Drugcap.com.
JACKIE: Why I got to do it?
MIN: Just do it babe, it takes 2 fucking minutes.
JACKIE and MIN argue over who should go into the website DRUGCAP.COM
MIN: Go onto the website and look up my docket number and type in my name. I
don't know my docket number.

MIN: Click on it. It will go onto another link.
MIN tells JACKIE how to check on the website.
MIN complains to JACKIE about his neck pain.
MIN and JACKIE agree on using JACKIE'S debit car on the website.
MIN: Let me know if it's done. I'm going to call the cab to CJ's and I'm going to

what I mean? I don't know who that fuck it is bro. That nigga, is following us. [Stammers] I don't
know where those nigga's are at. If it's someone had beef with, you know? I don't fucking know.
I wasn't thinking like that so, fucking uhmm... the nigga.... pretty much bro, like...whatever,,
[Stammers] he dropped me off here, but his car [Stammers] he was still driving. I opened the
door. I said, 'Okay.' 'Drive as you go.' Because he started making mad turns, you know what I
mean? And the nigga was throwing weren't throwing the siren, it was a GMC, usually he has a
siren on or some shit, like last time he knocked my cousin out, he had siren on, whatever so.
[Aside: Come on Metro, stop playing, come on, come on ] So they fucking follow us.... fucking
Brooklyn off the bridge bro. We ain't go were we had to go, you know, the usual but.... uhh...
but that shit was kind of scary, my nigga, but I feel like it was a Tuesday night. My cousin is mad
and everything.... Yo....'you don't think, these fucking nigga's are watching or something?' I was
like bro, ' I don't see them watching....and if they seen us do that.... they would had busted

started walking pretty fast... Something told me, 'Yo, walk faster.' I hid around a corner and I
heard a car reversing my nigga. I hear a car reversing.
UM6884:A-ha.
MIN: They .... I finally get to my parent's house, they drive by, right... they
fucking... I go inside and maybe I'm bugging. You know what I mean. Maybe they're fucking
trying to find parking I don't know. You know what I mean?

house, I come back out and shit. Then, fucking what happened.. uhmmm, I come back out and
my pops is gonna drive me back home because I had a dog. So I come in front of the house
and I'm sitting down, whatever. I have Metro in the front then, my dad come out with Leo and
these nigga's drive by again, they drive by again and they pull up into the convenient.
..I'm like these niggas are up to no good.

the convenient. They pulled up in the convenient, whatever. Then uhmmm, I'm like, 'What the
fuck, these nigga's are up to no good whatever.' So, they get out the six, [Unintelligible]. I wish I
had a car opened, to make it work. [Background : Noise] [Unintelligible]
UM6884:Ah-ha.
MIN: So, me and him were making straight eye contact. I'm thinking like, this
nigga is definitely looking for tags or some shit. I'm thinking in my head, maybe is beef with me,
the second he went, augh , augh (clear throat) and shit.
UM6884:Yeah
MIN: So whatever, either one. Nigga walks by... he fucking... my dad outside
with dog now... he goes...'oh that's a nice dog' and he walks by. His man comes around and
picks him up by the driveway, he picks him up and gets in a whip and uhmm, he just kept on
driving and he bounce. I never seen him again.... I was like, 'what the fuck'. So then, I bang on
the window and I tell my mom, my dad wants to walk the dog. Obviously, [Unintelligible] my
pops there, you know what I mean. I looked down the block, I go inside to see what fucking
happened. I was like, 'you know what?' I'm gonna fucking tell her, because I don't know what
the fuck is going on....Let her know for her own good. So I tell her and shit and huh, nigga... they
think is my fault, I did something obviously I went in on them. I called Tariq, he tells me, Oh,
those are niggar's that [Riq [phonetic] got beef with. He said, ' huh, a chain went missing, so...
we tried... uh....or this...whatever, you know what we mean? He trying to say, uh, he said, you
know Gino's been extorted. You know Gino's been extorted? I heard... you know what I mean?
[Unintelligible] somebody that really think that. You know what I mean? So whatever... So he is
trying to say, he told me the whole story, so I was tight.... the next day, when I was talking to uh,...
going to the ferry and shit. I said, 'let me call this nigga one more time.' So, I called him.
[Aside: Come on Metro] so I called him one more time.... I asked him, 'Yo, the nigga's know
about me? He's like, 'nah,' I said, 'are you fucking sure? I need to know, if these nigga's know
about me or not?' He's like 'nah, they don't know about me, they don't know about you, trust
me.' I was like, Yo, what's up bro, what's going on? I never got brought up, I was never the
topic, any of that shit.. He was like nah, I was like, alright. I was like.... Yo, but... I was like, I
don't know man...the nigga looked at me, like he wanted fucking robbed me and I had mad
bread on me, though, that day. Mad bread, you know what I mean....so I just finished doing what
I was doing. So, [Aside: I need a pack ah, South.] And a fucking, uhmm.... Tariq was like,
nah.... I was like, are you sure? I'm like, I've seen Mark's car, I see Mark's still chilling there. He
said, yeah, Mark was there when things got robbed, he didn't do nothing. I was like, oh so, I
said, Mark said something? I don't know, boo I he said, I don't know, I wouldn't doubt it. You
know he's corny, trying to throw nigga's under the bus, you know what I mean...like. All right, no
doubt, I'm gonna call Mark myself, I'll call you back. I called Mark, I was like, 'yo, bro, be honest

right? Fucking.... he's like yeah....basically let me tell you what Mark said, Gino's chain went
missing...I said, all right. Gino chain went missing... they told to call Riq [Phonetic]. They think
Riq [phonetic] has it..... but I wouldn't doubt it... that Riq.. fuck... stole it.... you know honestly, I
wouldn't doubt Ty [Phonetic] stole it.... for real, you know what I mean.
UM6884: Right.
MIN: I wouldn't fucking doubt it, my nigga, you know what I mean? The nigga can't be
brought out and that's what they do in that circle, you know what I mean?
UM6884: Yeah.
MIN: You know that already bro. I'm not trying to put the blame game on
anybody...and you know what's funny... it could had been anybody [Unintelligible] that did it... and
we fucking blaming Riq [phonetic] all time and Ty, nigga. You know what I mean? They could
had put that shit in their pocket, you know those nigga's are out.
UM6884:100 percent. It could had been them, yeah.
MIN: Yeah, because me and Harold went there yesterday and I agree bro, I was
thinking about that. I was like so then... [Aside: Come on Metro, go up] so uhmm...So I
fucking.... he is telling me the story and he 's like.... what he said to me? 'Yeah, fucking Tariq
[phonetic] . I said, honestly, what [Unintelligible] he said, yeah, Riq[ phonetic] stole. I don't know
which why they are trying to say Riq stole the chain, whatever....[Aside: Come on Metro, go up
the upstairs]... then whatever, so I'm like, damn.... so then... fucking... Marie [phonetic] came,
no carol, started arguing like.... Rig didn't steal it..he didn't even keep his mouth shut, you know
what I mean... like. Like always, he put his fucking two cents in.. the nigga's weren't saying
nothing, Mark told me, at all, but he kept running his fucking mouth and the nigga's were now you
giving me this shit....Obviously they backed out on him, you know what I mean.
UM6884:Yeah.
MIN: He got rob.... Riq came and robbed him to whatever... Mark was tight... Riq
fucking worked with my bread, you know what I mean?... Like.
UM6884:Yeah.
MIN: So, obviously Mark is like fucking tight....Dan [Phonetic] lost 1400 dollars.
So... It's Riq's fault not Mark's. If it was me, I would tell Riq, he has to come out with the bread.
UM6884:Yeah.
MIN: Obviously... so that's that happened. That happened to Tariq, I told....I kept
it at buck, with fucking Mark. I was like.... Yo, my nigga, obviously...I asked him, if uh.... he goes,
'I haven't chilled there since it happened , so where where you? All right, I don't know when it
happened, I've seen his car there....was it the day, parked or the day before some shit.
Whatever, he said, I haven't been chilling there. So really... I haven't seen them. I haven't seen
them since that happened. I haven't seen them, he was chilling there but he was like, yeah my
nigga, so basically, Ty is fine.
UM6884: You mean, you mean, like for why it happened? Of course, of course.
[Voices overlap]
MIN: He opened... you know what I mean.
UM6884:I was telling, I was telling [Unintelligible] because he know about.... I'm like look,
because he's always taking a [Unintelligible] bro. If it was Pete or I don't know, Frankie
[Unintelligible] telling me the story, it would be much different, I would believe it. Right, you know
what I mean? I can't believe everything Tariq says, I'm not saying his lying, I told him, but I also
heard already a couple of stories of this side of what happened, so...clearly somebody is lying.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: With that bitch. With Donna. [Unintelligible] with Donna... he didn't want to keep his
mouth shut. I heard he was talking mad crazy with the nigga. Like 'come on my ingga, you mad
hot.' He's like 'bro'; and like Mark told me the story. Marks like; my nigga was calm and shit bro.
That nigga looked at me like... trying to violate Tariq. Do you know what I mean? Like.
UM6884:Yeah, he always asks for it. The Indians probably... the Indians are mad good...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Running his fucking mouth. He don't know how to go about it.
UM6884:Even the Arabs bro. I've seen these niggas for 10, 15 years now in the neighborhood.
Never a problem with these kids, you know?
MIN: Hmm.
UM6884:Whoever they are. I don't know them by name, just by face, you know what I mean?
MIN: Yeah.
UM6884:Obviously Tariq has an issue cause he's like they robbed them.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Who?
UM6884:He said the... they're like 28 maybe, 30 years old... Arab niggas, Indian kind of, you
know? Like a little chubby. They're in the neighborhood.
MIN: They robbed Tariq?
UM6884:Yeah, this was like a few months ago, you know what I mean?
MIN: Oh my, yo Stevie was telling me.
[Voices Overlap]
UM6884:Meanwhile they're like normal people, you know what I'm saying? Between you and I,
they're normal people. They're not even involved in shit like this, you know what I'm saying?
MIN: And why they robbed him?
UM6884:I'm sure he mouthed off. Come on bro, let's be real, you know?
MIN: Yeah. Of course.
[Voices Overlap]
UM6884:He doesn't know how to handle it, like you know what I mean?
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Yeah, we're the same way. Somebody starts running their fucking mouth,
[Unintelligible] nigga. Fuck you nigga, your deaded.
UM6884:I mean I did that while you were there. I ain't giving you cent.
MIN: I can't judge, you know what I mean? If I did that and you did that and I was
with you to do that. It's like 'yeah do it bro, I'm down.' You know what I mean?
UM6884:Yeah cause... so even with that, I just feel like... he just says his side of the story. He
doesn't say exactly what happened all the time, you know?
MIN: Yeah, he needs to relax. [Aside: Oh Metro, your leash is on still.] Yeah my
nigga, I don't know bro, because... I don't know bro, this fucking kids a fucking retard. I don't
know bro. Yo these niggas came by my fucking crib bro, like come on man.
UM6884:I know, that's fucking crazy.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: I told my mom. Yo, I [Unintelligible] my mother. I'm like 'yo, I'm not fighting
with this nigga no more. I told her, throw him the fuck out. You have to. I'm sorry, I don't feel bad
no more. I don't. I'm like 'what's next?' And Mark kept it real. He goes 'that nigga was at Shot
bro, he's probably [Unintelligible] last night.' Them niggas roll to Shots all the time. They beef
with niggas like that. I'm like woah. So if my mom goes out the house and Tariq walks out with
her. They're gonna fucking shoot, they don't give a fuck. These niggas don't care. Tariqs called a
nigga; oh this is what happened, even worst. This is why it escalated, I just remembered. This is
why it escalated, niggas come by the crib. They called Ehab saying like 'yo, you're not involved
in this', you know what I mean? Trying to tell his younger brother like 'there's no problem with
you. You're brother mouthed off on some shit.' I wouldn't doubt it. They probably think he's a cool
nigga and mad relaxed and chill, like 'yo, his brother is mad humble like... we fuck with the
nigga.' But his older brother is a bird, you know what I mean? Like that niggas a fucking...
[Voices Overlap]
UM6884:Damn, they even reached out like that? That's crazy. That's how you know Tariq is in
the wrong, you know?
MIN: They reached out to Ehab. Why would they call Ehab for? to threaten him
bro? Whatever my nigga... Ehab I know [Unintelligible] dad. He wasn't there so I don't think; why
would they call him? They don't think he's gonna do something to his younger brother, you know
what I mean?
UM6884:Did they call him to press him or did they call and be like 'yo, you're cool.'
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Mark told me they called him to tell him 'yo you're gucci, you're good.'
UM6884:Yeah. He told me they called him to press him.
MIN: I don't know, we should ask Ehab. If I see him, I'ma ask him.
UM6884:Yeah. Gotta ask him himself bro, you know? He'll probably tell the truth.
MIN: I don't know what Tags [Unintelligible] had to say. Oh, Ralph talking to
Mark? This how I know [Unintelligible] blind, cause he's texting Mark... 'yo, Min's gonna call you.
He's gonna ask you about what happened. Whatever you say, just keep it short and simple.'
UM6884:Yeah?
MIN: Mark was like 'yo'; and I'ma tell Mark 'yo, you could send me those screen
shots my nigga?' I could ask him like what's up? You know? But he was telling me... like 'yo he's
texting me this as I'm talking to you my nigga.'
UM6884:That's crazy.
MIN: So I wouldn't; I'm sure Mark wouldn't make that up.
UM6884:That's how conniving the nigga is bro.
MIN: Because you know what? Niggas don't wanna be involved in that. Do you
know what I mean? They'll keep it a buck. Like 'nigga fuck him! He's fucking lying, I'm over that
shit', you know what I mean? That nigga ran his mouth, that's it. That's how he made it seem like.
Like my nigga... trust me bro. Niggas don't talk about. He wasn't trying to shit on me but he was
like 'niggas don't even talk bro about you and bring your business up, you know what I mean?
Like it's not like that... you know? So... I don't know bro, it's kind of fishy, fishy.
UM6884:Mad fishy bro. I just left it behind but, yeah I heard a couple of different sides of the
story too. It's made me believe immediately he was lying.
MIN: Tags always adds fuel to the fire bro, do you know what I mean? Like... he
adds fuel like, niggas a re beefing already bro, why would you add fuel to the fire. Call the nigga.
He threatened their life. Like him and Reek called him like 'yo, where gonna kill you.' Them
niggas like yeah? Aight.
UM6884: of course, I know, I know, it's like dude, who are you killing bro? Like you
know what I'm saying?
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: Nobody. And he don't got nobody. He goes, 'I'm on deck with the phone for
the nigga from Far Rock you get at that nigga.' I wanna tell him in person, like when I see him...
'why it has to get to that point where I gotta call somebody to... get at these dudes bro? That's
corny bro. Why do you involve yourself with these kind of people my nigga?' He don't chill with us
no more. I told Pete he's a rapper now, he's a star... he's up with all the famous niggas now, do
you know what I mean?
UM6884:Yeah.
MIN: You know why all this shit's happening to him all the time? His big ass
mouth. He don't know how to be himself and stay humble and quiet. Just be yourself my nigga.
You don't gotta be a loud one to fucking show everybody something. You don't gotta prove
yourself no more cuz, like nobody gives a fuck about that. Niggas rather you be quiet in peace
bro, not bother nobody, not even fight with niggas.
[Voices Overlap]
UM6884:I told him it's very simple. You don't understand how to stay home. 'Go home!' You
know what I mean? Why you always gotta be somewhere? I was telling him like 'go the fuck
home! Go to [Unintelligible], go home! Go somewhere, you know what I mean? Like niggas get
bored and they just hang out with anybody that they can, like what is wrong with you?
MIN: Yo you see that shit right?
[Voices Overlap]
UM6884:If none of my friends; I've been living like this for years. If none of my close friends that I
could think of off the top of my head are around, I'm staying my ass home.
MIN: Yep.
UM6884:I'm not gonna start calling [Unintelligible] who I'm cool with, or... you know what I mean?
I'm cool with him but I'm not cool with him to hang out... I'ma go home! You know what I mean? I'll
call you, Pete... the Indians... regular people. Niggas ain't around, I'm going home, you know?
MIN: You're absolutely right bro... you're absolutely right my nigga.
UM6884:But these niggas don't do that, they hang out with anybody. ' Ah Squid, yeah Squid.'
Nigga fuck Squid! You know what I'm saying?
MIN: Squid don't give a fuck about the niggas.
UM6884:He probably set them up. Who knows what happened bro.
MIN: He probably like 'yo listen, ya wanna rob me? Ya could rob these niggas, I'll
play it cool', you know what I mean? Like chill... niggas is really pussy like that bro. They'll do
that.
UM6884:Yeah but for me... for me, I'll just stay away though. I ain't got no hard feelings towards
Tariq but I know how he is after all these years, so I just stay away, you know?
MIN: Yeah.
UM6884:I know he knows we don't really hang out much, you know? That's just... I just want live
a regular life, you know what I mean? And guess what? Obviously he calls me... 'can you do me
a favor?' You know?
MIN: Who, Tariq?
UM6884:Of course! Who else is he gonna call? 'Can you do me a favor, do you think you could
shave something off?' I'm like 'dude... you're always coming to me, you know what I'm saying?
It's your life, you're problems bro... like how many times do I have to help out, you know?'
MIN: Stupid fuck.
UM6884:Especially considering he probably instigated the whole thing, now I gotta pay for your
dumb... you know what I mean?
MIN: Look, let's just say no to him. You say no? You're a fucking faggot...
[Voices Overlap]
UM6884:Of course bro. That's exactly what it is. I never said no. Let me tell him no one time out
of the...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: That's how you see who your real friends are when you say no to a nigga.
UM6884:Yeah but I don't need the test, you understand?
MIN: Yeah I'm just saying though, that's the truth though. When you say no? A real
niggas true color start coming out. You'll see how they act about it. Be like 'you know what,
you're right, it's cool.' They understand.
UM6884:Yeah.
MIN: He's never understanding.
UM6884:He would never understand the no.
MIN: Even if you got it, it's the principal my nigga. It's mine cuz, like I can't do
nothing right now my nigga. I'm trying to do things. It's basically a set back. When he; like when
you do shit like this and you try to help a friend out, you set yourself back, you know what I mean?
UM6884:Yeah.
MIN: It's going back to the same shit... and it's weird. It will never change, you
know what I mean? How will it ever change if you're always stepping back, you know?
UM6884:Yes.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: That niggas always taking the same steps back bro. He does good a few
months, and he's away from everybody. Then goes back. That's why; bro, I was doing the
same... it's the end my nigga. I'm 24, it's not gonna get any better cuz from here if I keep doing
that.
UM6884:Absolutely bro, I mean you are at least sticking out to it right now, you know? Just stay
clear. That's good bro.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: She's freaking hot, don't get me wrong. She's hot... it happened. It happens
to a lot of us, you know what I mean?
UM6884:It's fine, you just gotta change a lot of things, that's all. In you're routine, you're good.
MIN: I know. If I go there to chill, I gotta stay inside. I can't walk to my parents,
nothing. I have to stay there, hang out... but that's it, not in the mood, you know what I mean?
UM6884:Yeah.
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: I'm there to come out and go home, you know?
UM6884:100%.
MIN: That's it, I gotta really; I don't care if I'm on a rush no more. I been rushing...
because... I'm not doing it no more, I don't give a fuck. I'm just letting niggas know... yo it's hot,
can't do it.
UM6884:Hey you can't rush. You either make them wait for it or you wake up earlier, or
whatever you gotta do to actually prepare, you know? So you don't rush. Rushings no good,
rushings no good... never... you know? I did that yesterday. I never try to rush. I'd rather...
[Voices Overlap]
MIN: It sucks my nigga. And when you do... and that's when you get caught up
cause... you do. You run at a fast pace... they say the fast life will get you caught up bro.
UM6884:Yeah bro. What are you doing? You gonna be around when I get back? Today I'm not
doing shit.
